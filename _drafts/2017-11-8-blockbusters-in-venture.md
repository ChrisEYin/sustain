I think there’s a lot we can learn in venture from hollywood. The more time I spend with founders & VC’s, the more I realize that the two businesses are closely related.

So I recently read [Blockbusters](https://www.amazon.com/Blockbusters-Hit-making-Risk-taking-Business-Entertainment/dp/B00JV50YUG/ref=pd_cp_14_4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=0M0R8K4V2K1H5SJ2W3A7). To be honest this is one of those books that should be a blog post. It makes a few interesting points, and then proceeds to beat you over the head with examples.

The core of the book is that Hollywood is largely driven off blockbusters, or big concentrated wins. All the revenue in the business comes from a few big winners, and everything else is done in service of these winners. 

> One of the essential lessons - the surest way to lasting success in show business - is to bet heavily on likely blockbusters and spending considerably less on the “also rans” is the surest way to lasting success in show business.

Just like venture, the game is highly concentrated. The [vast majority of returns](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/the-meeting-that-showed-me-the-truth-about-vcs/) come from a handful of deals. The cost of missing a big winner is much greater than the cost of losing money on a few smaller deals. 

So the obvious next question is — why do anything but blockbuster type deals? Why not just focus on making a few large movies per year and the ignore the smaller films?

> Smaller bets can also help a media producer “fill the pipeline,” thereby keeping companies that help sell the producer’s output satisfied. For example, a book publisher that delivers a steady stream of new titles to the market will find it easier to build and maintain relationships with retailers.

In our world ‘retailers’ could be prospective customers that you interact with or other VC’s, both parallel and downstream as well. Showing them that you’re in the flow & making moves is a big part of it.

> Pursuing a wide range of smaller projects allows studios, publishers, and other entertainment businesses to form closer links with agents, who are involved in the lion’s share of deals for new products and therefore critical gatekeepers in virtually any entertainment sector. Going for smaller-scale products can enable entertainment companies to build and maintain a favorable critical reputation as well, which in turn can help them attract sought-after A-list talent and their projects

And this is probably the most important part. The reason you take smaller bets, do seed deals, co-invest in some companies can be to show that you’re in it. It’s impossible to find all the deals yourselves — and so you want to make sure you’re continually doing deals so that those upstream will remember you and call on you.

And similar to venture, the long tail is not really a thing. The internet has given us more options, but ultimately the money is more highly concentrated at the top.

> All in all, although advances in digital technologies may at first blush seem to have a “democratizing” influence, in reality they tend to have the opposite effect: they foster concentration and a winner-take-all dynamic.

And just like in startups, the ‘pipe’ in which media is delivered through ultimately changes the nature of the content being delivered.

> Customer benefits often change when products are distributed through different channels, even if the only apparent change is the “pipe” through which offerings reach the customer

And with that, will leave you with an easy one.
