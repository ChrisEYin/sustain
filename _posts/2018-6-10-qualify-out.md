When I was working on my startup I spent an inordinate amount of time selling. Selling my idea to potential team members, benefits of the product to customers, future financial returns to investors, etc. 

It was a slog. I did hundreds of these conversations. And the receiving end was typically only half listening, completely disinterested, or just straight up thought I was full of shit.

But being a founder means that you’re supposedly to be irrationally optimistic. If everyone else already knew what you knew, then there wouldn’t be a market opportunity. The nature of [good ideas](/startups/2016/08/17/good-ideas/) is being non-consensus and right, yeah?

The obvious downside to being non consensus is that few people believe you. But having an overabundance of self confidence, I was convinced that with enough time & effort, I would be able to convince anyone that my world view was the future.

So for each conversation I had, no matter what they said, I never heard no. I always found the time to email back, schedule follow ons, track them down via other means, etc. I was persistent if nothing else. 

Fortunately over time, I found my first set of customers. I found a few investors that were interested. But something about these conversations were different. I didn't need to do 15 follow ups. I didn't need to reschedule 10 times and constantly pester them. They never said "if only your product did this, then maybe." They always got it quickly and made the process easy & low stress -- despite the obvious shortcomings in the product. 

And the difference was -- I didn't have to "convert" them over to my world view. They already saw it. There was no hard sell, no reluctance, no ball fetching. They were bought in very early and were eager to get to work and help. 

I meet a lot of early stage companies. And I find that they often tell me similar stories -- chasing people around, stretching their product to get that reluctant customer or investor. And I tell them to stop. They shouldn't be contorting themselves, the product, or the vision to sell anyone that early on. You don't need everyone in the world to believe, just need a few.

There are a million customers out there for every product. So when you're both resource & time constrained, you need to optimize your process around quickly finding your first 10. Everyone else is still a potential convert -- but later. Focus & prioritize.

And over time as you move up and get more resources, then you'll have earned the right (and the breathing room) to start selling. In sales you are always trying to qualify folks into the funnnel. But in the early stages, you want to flip this and quickly qualify out instead.
