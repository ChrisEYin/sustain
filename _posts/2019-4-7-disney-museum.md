I recently went to the [Walt Disney museum](https://www.waltdisney.org/) and left feeling pretty inspired. The museum takes you through Walt's early days to his rise, and ultimately to his death. It was amazing to see the story behind so many of the iconic movies I grew up with and also see Walt's entire life on display. 

We often see Walt as a creative genius, but forget that he's also one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. What struck me about was how similar his story felt to the founders we read about. He not only had to persevere through major setbacks on his way to success but was an optimist focused on experimenting & innovating all the way to the end. 

**Walt’s Early Struggle**

Despite being an enormous success by the end of his life, his career had several false starts and struggles. He started his first company called [Laugh-O-Gram Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh-O-Gram_Studio) in 1921 when he was just 20 years old. He and a small group of animators came together to produce short cartoons, which were generally well received. But they had trouble making money (Walt lived in the office and took baths at Union Station for awhile) and within 2 years they had to close shop.

He then took off for Hollywood. But when he got there, he was dismayed -- he thought he was too late and he had missed his chance in cartoons. 

> “Now when I got to Hollywood, I was discouraged with animation, I didn’t think I’d ever do another animated thing. I said, I think I’m getting in it too late. Felix the Cat was going then, other things, and I just said, it’s too late. I should have been in the business six years before.” 

It's interesting to hear one of the great animators lamenting about being too late to the industry he later defined. It reminded me of [a quip from Marc Andreessen](https://youtu.be/oOe05w1gLrE?t=227) that had a similar sentiment - Marc also thought he was too late when he got to Silicon Valley in the 90’s (he then went on to create [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape), which sold for $10B).

And even one of Walt’s early success stories, [Oswald the Lucky Rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_the_Lucky_Rabbit), also started off as a disappointment. The first Oswald cartoon was rejected by Universal and Walt had to defend both himself and  his partner [Ub Iwerks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ub_Iwerks) to the studio.

> “I am sorry that the first OSWALD was such a keen disappointment to everyone. [...] We will aim to make Oswald a younger character, peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him all neat and trim.” — Walt, 1927

Once Oswald starting taking off, Walt again hit another roadblock. His distributor, [Charles Mintz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mintz), ended up going around his back and undercutting Walt. He signed all of Walt’s animators to a cheaper contract and demanded that Walt take less money. Walt refused, and he and Ub quit to start all over.

Finally, even Mickey Mouse wasn’t an immediate success. The first two cartoons Walt created with Mickey were flops. Audiences weren’t familiar with this character and reception was not good. He wasn’t even able to garner enough support get distributors to pick it up. Fortunately he kept at it and on the third try, they created [Steamboat Willie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie) and took off from there.

**Bold Experimentation**

Another key part of Walt’s story is bold bets and experimentation. After the first two Mickey Mouse cartoons failed, Walt decided to make Steamboat Willie with one notable difference -- he wanted it to have sound. The first movie with synchronized sound had  just come out the year prior and Walt was inspired to try this on his cartoons. And so he bet everything on it.

> “I planned to go all out on sound. Those plans came very near to spelling a major disaster for us. […] The musicians were to cost $10 an hour. I thought 15 men would be enough, but the director insisted on having 30 men. Because I was awed by him, I was finally persuaded to take the thirty. The upshot was that I had to borrow on my automobile and Roy and I had to mortgage our homes to cover the cost of the first synchronization of Steamboat Willie. And when it finished, the picture wouldn’t synchronize with the sound and we had to do it all over.” - Walt Disney

Despite risking everything, Walt’s creativity and desire to experiment paid off. Steamboat Willie was a huge success and put both Walt & Mickey on the map.

Another example is Walt's foray into feature length films. Despite seeing success in short form cartoons, Walt thought it was too niche and wanted to expand. He decided to create [Snow White and the Seven Dwarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)), the first fully animated feature length film. Critics were incredibly skeptical (it was known as [Disney’s Folly](https://www.neatorama.com/2012/06/13/disneys-folly-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/)) and even his wife thought it would fail. Not only that, it was an enormous financial bet, coming in at 400% over budget and ultimately costing more than the value of the entire studio at the time. 

But it worked out. It was met with a standing ovation, sold over 109 million tickets, became one of the top-10 American film moneymakers of all time, and won an Oscar.

And near the end of Walt's career after he was famous & wealthy, Walt was still making bold bets and willing to put it all on the line. He created [WED Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering) to act as his private innovation lab. What came from it was Disneyland -- his most ambitious project yet. He would again throw it all on the line to create this.  

> “At the beginning, it was all of his money. In fact, he hocked is life insurance and a few other things to get the money, to get to do the things that he wanted to do to get the Disneyland project started.” — Mickey Clark, Walt's business manager

Even then there was a rocky start. Launch day (July 17, 1955) was a massive failure -- so bad, we now call it Black Sunday. But Walt tried pushed through and tried again -- he re-invited the guests back for a second day and it grew from there.

Walt's ambition was larger than life. His story is amazing and he's given us all so much. The museum is worth checking out.
