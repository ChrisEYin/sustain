I’ve been thinking about my writing recently. I’e been writing publicly since 2012 and my blog has gone through several different phases. And it may time for another one.

I’ve always really enjoyed the process of writing, but I haven’t always loved the pieces I’ve put out there. And I’ve realized that it’s because I’ve bundled too many different types of writing together. And so the result is a jumble of different things — rough ideas I’m exploring, ideas I’m trying to put out there, statements I’m trying to make, etc. 

And the original sin is that I’ve been focused too much on writing for the sake of showcasing my writing. And this leads to some contorted writing that doesn’t deserve to be out there. And so it’s time to turn the focus away from writing for the sake of writing to writing for myself. My writing should be filled with ideas that I personally revisit over and over, things I share around to others. And when I look at my writing today, only a handful of posts even come close.

So I’m going to archive a big part of my blog. And going forward, this place will mostly be ideas that are closer to the bottom of the funnel. Rougher ideas will live elsewhere, and it will give me some freedom to explore rough things more freely and then only pick out the worthwhile things into more well developed posts that can live here.
