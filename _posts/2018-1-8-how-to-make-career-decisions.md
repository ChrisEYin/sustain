I remember a coffee meeting with a founder who told me that she was surprised at how lucky I've gotten in my career so far. And it's true -- I've definitely been very lucky. From first meeting Parand, to him letting me join Xpenser, getting acquired by Coupa, and ultimately Coupa going public. 

It got me thinking -- how much of what I've done is a result of hard work + luck vs. just pure luck? It's dangerous [to confuse luck & skill](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/luck-and-skill-untangled-qa-with-michael-mauboussin/), and so I wanted to better tease this out to help me make better decisions, especially as it relates to my career. 

I've always thought about my work through the lens of a few basic principles -- work hard, be honest with myself, always keep learning & evolving, and keep trying / don't give up. I (naively) thought that as long as I did these things, the rest would take care of itself and good things would follow.  

These guidelines were too simple, too focused on me. And they're not that helpful in choosing what to do in your work life. There are far more things to consider in order to up your chances that things work out. I've seen folks that were smarter & harder working than me get sidelined in their careers just because they were in the wrong place. And I've seen the inverse as well. 

So I did a bit of reading and compiled some general career advice. Below is a consolidated & summarized list from [Marc Andreessen](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part1.html)([2](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html), [3](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part3.html)), [Reid Hoffman](http://www.businessinsider.com/career-advice-from-linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-2014-12?op=1), [Ben Horowitz](https://a16z.com/2015/05/28/some-career-advice-for-all-you-recent-graduates/), [Jeff Bezos](http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2016/10/the-jeff-bezos-regret-minimization-framework/), [Brad Feld](https://www.feld.com/archives/2010/02/be-the-ceo-of-your-job.html), [Hunter Walk](https://hunterwalk.com/2014/03/08/new-grads-midstage-startups-are-your-best-first-job-in-tech/)([2](https://hunterwalk.com/2013/10/08/dont-start-a-job-search-without-answering-this-one-question/)) and a few others. 

* Develop skills & prioritize jobs that maximize learning
* Building a tight and high quality network is far more important than title or compensation
* Fastest way to become someone/thing is to hang out with people who are already that
* Take intelligent risk that will give you a competitive edge
* Use the regret minimization framework to help with seemingly illogical decisions

This list was helpful, but I found it to be incomplete. When I was going through my career options, I found it tough to score each one against these points. My list was too broad -- I was trying to decide between entirely different fields and there were several very compelling paths that led towards a similar end state. 

The problem was that I was thinking too high level. I had to narrow scope and first decide between these different paths. So I wrote down and thought through a few high level questions that helped me narrow down the path I wanted to take. 

* In a perfect world, how would this play out and why?
* Remember that there are no shortcuts in life
* What do you want to be able to tell your children?
* What is in line with your values and who you are / want to be?
* What does your gut tell you?

Running through these questions helped me narrow down and focus on a path that I wanted to strive towards. Then I ran through the consolidated list of career maxims above to help me further evaluate & choose within the decided path. 

So the tl;dr - run through the 2nd list of questions to help decide on ideal career path / avenue, and then use the 1st list to help choose between options within that arena. And in closing, a recent tweet storm from [Sizhao Yang](https://twitter.com/zaoyang) that I really liked and echoed many of my own thoughts. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Everyone makes pros and con list to make decisions but they only take into account the first order effects or short term effects. The best decisions take advantage of embedded optionalities. It allows a hidden compounding that provides exposure to positive black swans. <a href="https://t.co/vdgvVkzA6Z">https://t.co/vdgvVkzA6Z</a></p>&mdash; Sizhao Yang (@zaoyang) <a href="https://twitter.com/zaoyang/status/949706485742714881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2018</a></blockquote>
