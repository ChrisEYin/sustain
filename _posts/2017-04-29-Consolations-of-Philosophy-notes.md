Recently read through [Alain de Botton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_de_Botton)’s [Consolations of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Consolations-Philosophy-Alain-Botton/dp/0679779175).  Alain helps us better understand a few topics with the help of some well known philosophers. A pretty light and easy read, but there were some decent stories. Some of my favorite passages below.

**On Thinking**

> It is by finding out what something is not that one comes closest to understanding what it is. [..] Knowledge involves understanding not only why something was true, but also why its alternatives were false.

[Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates) taught us how to think independently with the [socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). He argued that to truly understand a topic you have to not only think about why your position might be right, but also why opposing positions are wrong (similar to Jacobi’s saying “[invert, always invert](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/10/inversion/)” and Munger’s saying on “[doing the proper work to hold an opinion](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/)”.)

To form an independent thought, he suggests taking any argument and imagining that it’s wrong. Think through the conditions that would make it false to the find holes and inconsistencies in the original argument. Then revise the original argument and repeat this process until you’ve arrived at something which cannot be disproved.

> In writing a problem down or airing it in conversation we let its essential aspects emerge. And by knowing its character, we remove, if not the problem itself, then its secondary, aggravating characteristics: confusion, displacement, surprise.

[Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus) was a man who optimized his life for his version of happiness. One of his principles for a happy life was to spend time in thought. And in his view, writing was an important tool to help one truly think deeply through problems. 

Anytime I hit a problem or need to think through something, my solution is always to start by writing down the problem and my train of thought. It helps structure my thoughts process, pull out any assumptions, biases, etc. Writing clarifies, adds objectivity, and helps make better decisions. 

**On Fortune**

> We do not know what will happen next: we must expect something. [..] But we cannot always explain our destiny by referring to our moral worth; not everything which happens to us occurs with reference to something about us. It is tempting, when we are hurt, to believe that the thing which hurt us intended to do so.

[Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger) believed that philosophy was a tool to help people reconcile the delta between expectations and reality. He had his fair share of misfortune — his political career was cut short, he was exiled, robbed of his possessions, and ultimately killed himself on Emperor Nero’s orders.

So he made sure to think about [the goddess Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna) every morning. He explained that Fortune was a random element in our lives — sometime wreaking havoc and sometimes blessing us. But in both cases, the good or bad inflicted were random acts and not a judgement.

Humans are self centered by nature. So we often attribute good things that happen to us as a reflection of our recent good deeds and bad fortune as the opposite. But often the things that happen in our lives are random and we shouldn’t read too much in them. 

> Wisdom lies in correctly discerning where we are free to mould reality according to our wishes and where we must accept the unalterable with tranquillity. We are like dogs who have been tied to an unpredictable cart.

Related to the above, Seneca again helps us remember that we are merely “dogs who have ben tied to an unpredictable cart”. Meaning that while we do have some leeway, we are largely still tethered to randomness. And so in order to be content, we need to learn to separate what is under our control vs what isn’t — and only focus our energies on the former. 

**On Difficulty**

> What reads easily is rarely so written. Being incomprehensible offers unparalleled protection against having nothing to say.

[Montaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne) was a brilliant French philosopher and writer. However even he didn’t like long, boring books. He said “I am not prepared to bash my brains for anything, not even for learning’s sake. [..] If one book wearies me, I pick up another.”

A good reminder that simple and clear writing is a proxy for true understanding of a subject. “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”

> Fulfillment was to be reached not by avoiding pain, but by recognizing its role as a natural, inevitable step on the way to reaching anything good. If you decide for the former and desire to diminish and lower the level of human pain, you also have to diminish and lower the level of their capacity for joy. Not everything which makes us feel better is good for us. Not everything which hurts may be bad.

[Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) here reminds us that in order to truly live and experience life, we have to be willing to accept the other side of the coin — pain and suffering. It’s easy to want to avoid pain, but the life would be static. To be fulfilled is to embrace both the ups and downs of experiencing life.
