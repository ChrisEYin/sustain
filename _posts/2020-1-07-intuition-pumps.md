>  Mistakes are not just opportunities for learning; they are, in an important sense, the only opportunity for learning or making something truly new.

>  As Gore Vidal once said, “It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail.”

>  Evolution is one of the central themes of this book, as of all my books, for the simple reason that it is the central, enabling process not only of life but also of knowledge and learning and understanding.

>  The chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide them—especially not from yourself. Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should become a connoisseur of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind as if they were works of art, which in a way they are.

>  We human beings pride ourselves on our intelligence, and one of its hallmarks is that we can remember our previous thinking, and reflect on it—on how it seemed, on why it was tempting in the first place, and then about what went wrong.

>  reductio ad absurdum—literally, reduction (of the argument) to absurdity. You take the assertion or conjecture at issue and see if you can pry any contradictions (or just preposterous implications) out of it.

>  The French neuroscientist Jean-Pierre Changeux and I once debated neuroscientist Sir John Eccles and philosopher Sir Karl Popper about consciousness and the brain at a conference in Venice. Changeux and I were the materialists (who maintain that the mind is the brain), and Popper and Eccles the dualists (who claim that a mind is not a material thing like a brain, but some other, second kind of entity that interacts with the brain).

>  How to compose a successful critical commentary: 1. You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.” 2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement). 3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target. 4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

>  Sturgeon’s Law is usually put a little less decorously: Ninety percent of everything is crap.

>  The idea is straightforward: don’t concoct a complicated, extravagant theory if you’ve got a simpler one (containing fewer ingredients, fewer entities) that handles the phenomenon just as well.

>  Conwy Lloyd Morgan, a nineteenth-century British psychologist, extended the idea to cover attributions of mentality to animals. Lloyd Morgan’s Canon of Parsimony advises us not to attribute fancy minds to insects, fish, and even dolphins, dogs, and cats if their behavior can be explained in simpler terms:

>  delicious play on Occam’s Razor, introducing the new term Occam’s Broom, to describe the process in which inconvenient facts are whisked under the rug by intellectually dishonest champions of one theory or another.

>  When experts talk to experts, whether they are in the same discipline or not, they always err on the side of under-explaining.

>  But this gracious disposition to assume more understanding than is apt to be present in one’s distinguished audience has an unfortunate by-product: experts often talk past each other.

>  By addressing their remarks to the undergraduates (the decoy audience), speakers need not worry at all about insulting the experts because they are not addressing the experts.

>  jootsing, which stands for “jumping out of the system.” This is an important tactic not just in science and philosophy, but also in the arts. Creativity, that ardently sought but only rarely found virtue, often is a heretofore unimagined violation of the rules of the system from which it springs.

>  Being creative is not just a matter of casting about for something novel—anybody can do that, since novelty can be found in any random juxtaposition of stuff—but of making the novelty jump out of some system, a system that has become somewhat established, for good reasons.

>  It helps to know the tradition if you want to subvert it. That’s why so few dabblers or novices succeed in coming up with anything truly creative. Sit down at a piano and try to come up with a good new melody and you soon discover how hard it is. All the keys are available, in any combination you choose, but until you can find something to lean on, some style or genre or pattern to lay down and exploit a bit, or allude to, before you twist it, you will come up with nothing but noise.

>  Advising somebody to make progress by jootsing is rather like advising an investor to buy low and sell high. Yes, of course, that’s the idea, but how do you manage to do it?

>  When you are confronting a scientific or philosophical problem, the system you need to jump out of is typically so entrenched that it is as invisible as the air you breathe.

>  Rathering is a way of sliding you swiftly and gently past a false dichotomy.

>  Not always, not even most of the time, but often the word “surely” is as good as a blinking light locating a weak point in the argument, a warning label about a likely boom crutch.

>  A rhetorical question has a question mark at the end, but it is not meant to be answered.

>  Here is a good habit to develop: Whenever you see a rhetorical question, try—silently, to yourself—to give it an unobvious answer.

>  deepity is a proposition that seems both important and true—and profound—but that achieves this effect by being ambiguous.

>  The manifest image is the world as it seems to us in everyday life, full of solid objects, colors and smells and tastes, voices and shadows, plants and animals, and people and all their stuff: not only tables and chairs, bridges and churches, dollars and contracts, but also such intangible things as songs, poems, opportunities, and free will.

>  scientific image: molecules, atoms, electrons, and quarks and their ilk. Is anything really solid? The physicist Sir Arthur Eddington wrote, early in the twentieth century, about the “two tables,” the solid one of everyday experience and the one composed of atoms, widely separated in mainly empty space, more like a galaxy than a piece of wood.

>  Sellars (1963, p. 1) famously said, “The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.”

>  Philosophers call a list of things deemed to exist an ontology (from the Greek word for “thing,” surprise, surprise).

>  Another name for it is the organism’s Umwelt (von Uexküll, 1957; Umwelt is the German word for “environment,” surprise, surprise). An animal’s Umwelt consists in the first place of affordances (Gibson, 1979), things to eat or mate with, or shun, openings to walk through or look out of, holes to hide in, things to stand on, and so forth.

>  One of my favorite examples of how different an Umwelt can be compares an anteater to an insectivorous bird (Wimsatt, 1980). The bird tracks individual insects and must deal with their erratic flight patterns by having a high flicker-fusion rate (in effect it sees more “frames per second” than we do, and hence a movie would be like a slide show to it). The anteater just averages over the whole ant-infested area and lets its big tongue take up the slack. A philosopher might say that “ant” for an anteater is a mass term, like “water” and “ice” and “furniture,” not a sortal (you can count them) like “olives” and “raindrops” and “chairs.”

>  I proposed folk psychology as a term for the talent we all have for interpreting the people around us—and the animals and the robots and even the lowly thermostats—as agents with information about the world they act in (beliefs) and the goals (desires) they strive to achieve, choosing the most reasonable course of action, given their beliefs and desires.

>  Artists and philosophers agree on one thing: one of their self-appointed tasks is to “make the familiar strange.” 1 Some of the great strokes of creative genius get us to break through the crust of excessive familiarity, jootsing into the new perspective where we can look at ordinary, obvious things with fresh eyes.

>  still further other words, when you use folk psychology to anticipate and understand its moves, you have adopted the intentional stance.

>  The intentional stance is the strategy of interpreting the behavior of an entity (person, animal, artifact, or whatever) by treating it as if it were a rational agent who governed its “choice” of “action” by a “consideration” of its “beliefs” and “desires.”

>  Anything that is usefully and voluminously predictable from the intentional stance is, by definition, an intentional system, and as we shall see, many fascinating and complicated things that don’t have brains or eyes or ears or hands, and hence really don’t have minds, are nevertheless intentional systems. Folk psychology’s basic trick, that is to say, has some bonus applications outside the world of human interactions.

>  My move is an instance of nibbling on a tough problem instead of trying to eat (and digest) the whole thing from the outset. Many of the thinking tools I will be demonstrating are good at nibbling, at roughly locating a few “fixed” points that will help us see the general shape of the problem.

>  The physical stance is simply the standard laborious method of the physical sciences, in which we use whatever we know about the laws of physics and the physical constitution of the things in question to devise our predictions. When I predict that a stone released from my hand will fall to the ground, I am using the physical stance.

>  Alarm clocks, being designed objects (unlike a stone), are also amenable to a fancier style of prediction—prediction from the design stance.

>  I don’t need to work out the specific physical laws that explain this marvelous regularity; I simply assume that it has a particular design—the design we call an alarm clock—and that it will function properly, as designed. Design-stance predictions are riskier than physical-stance predictions because of the extra assumptions I have to take into account: 1. that an entity is designed as I suppose it to be, and 2. that it will operate according to that design—that is, it will not malfunction.

>  Designed things are occasionally misdesigned, and sometimes they break.

>  An even riskier and swifter stance is our main topic, the intentional stance, a subspecies of the design stance in which the designed thing is treated as an agent of sorts, with beliefs and desires and enough rationality to do what it ought to do given those beliefs and desires.

>  The intentional stance gives you the “specs,” the job description, of an intentional system—what it should discriminate, remember, and do, for instance—and leaves the implementation of those specs to the engineers (or evolution and development, in the case of an intentional system that is an organism).
