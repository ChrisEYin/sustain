>  The German physicist Max Planck calculated the electric field in equilibrium in a hot box. To do this he used a trick: he imagined that the energy of the field is distributed in “quanta,” that is, in packets or lumps of energy. The procedure led to a result that perfectly reproduced what was measured (and therefore must be in some fashion correct) but clashed with everything that was known at the time. Energy was considered to be something that varied continuously, and there was no reason to treat it as if it were made up of small building blocks.

>  These simple and clear lines are the real birth certificate of quantum theory. Note the wonderful initial “It seems to me . . . ,” which recalls the “I think . . .” with which Darwin introduces in his notebooks the great idea that species evolve, or the “hesitation” spoken of by Faraday when introducing for the first time the revolutionary idea of magnetic fields. Genius hesitates.

>  The answer is that each element corresponds to one solution of the main equation of quantum mechanics. The whole of chemistry emerges from a single equation.

>  In quantum mechanics no object has a definite position, except when colliding headlong with something else.

>  Einstein did not want to relent on what was for him the key issue: that there was an objective reality independent of whoever interacts with whatever.

>  The reason for this is that before experiments, measurements, mathematics, and rigorous deductions, science is above all about visions. Science begins with a vision. Scientific thought is fed by the capacity to “see” things differently than they have previously been seen.

>  Electrons, quarks, photons, and gluons are the components of everything that sways in the space around us. They are the “elementary particles” studied in particle physics.

>  The nature of these particles, and the way they move, is described by quantum mechanics.

>  Even if we observe a small, empty region of space in which there are no atoms, we still detect a minute swarming of these particles. There is no such thing as a real void, one that is completely empty. Just as the calmest sea looked at closely sways and trembles, however slightly, so the fields that form the world are subject to minute fluctuations, and it is possible to imagine its basic particles having brief and ephemeral existences, continually created and destroyed by these movements.

>  Quantum mechanics and experiments with particles have taught us that the world is a continuous, restless swarming of things, a continuous coming to light and disappearance of ephemeral entities. A set of vibrations, as in the switched-on hippie world of the 1960s. A world of happenings, not of things.

>  A handful of types of elementary particles, which vibrate and fluctuate constantly between existence and nonexistence and swarm in space, even when it seems that there is nothing there, combine together to infinity like the letters of a cosmic alphabet to tell the immense history of galaxies; of the innumerable stars; of sunlight; of mountains, woods, and fields of grain; of the smiling faces of the young at parties; and of the night sky studded with stars.

>  The central result of loop quantum gravity is indeed that space is not continuous, that it is not infinitely divisible but made up of grains, or “atoms of space.”

>  Where are these quanta of space? Nowhere. They are not in space because they are themselves the space. Space is created by the linking of these individual quanta of gravity. Once again, the world seems to be less about objects than about interactive relationships.

>  Cold air is air in which atoms, or rather molecules, move more slowly. Hot air is air in which molecules move more rapidly. Beautifully simple. But it doesn’t end there.
