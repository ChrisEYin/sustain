>  “They thought maybe the readers liked bad art because it’s crude, like a kid would draw,” says Jim Shooter, Marvel’s former editor-in-chief who worked at DC in the 1960s. “‘ Maybe we should tell the artists to draw worse.’ That’s a quote. I heard that.”

>  Angel—a full-page shot—and the caption was all about the glory of flying. And their attitude was, ‘What’s the big deal?’ Superman flies all the time.’ I’m like, ‘Don’t you get it? He flies all the time, and no one gives a damn.’ One guy held up a Spider-Man and said, ‘They’ve got two pages of Peter Parker talking to his aunt. The kids are going to be bored out of their minds.’ Nope.”

>  In 1940 a newspaper writer named Sterling North published an editorial in the Chicago Daily News entitled “A National Disgrace,” attacking the “poisonous” effects of a fast-growing new medium: comic books.

>  “Marvel was built on the idea of ‘Let’s see what’s selling for other people and imitate it,’” says comic writer and historian Evanier. “That was the history of [Marvel founder] Martin Goodman. He was notorious for it, and he owned up to it all the time.”

>  Kirby had been kicking around the comic industry for years. He’d cocreated Captain America for Marvel in 1940 before defecting to DC in 1941. He’d returned to Marvel in the late fifties after having a nasty legal falling-out with one of DC’s editors over royalties for a syndicated newspaper strip. DC’s loss was Marvel’s gain.

>  “We tried to inject all kinds of realism, as we call it, into the stories,” Lee said in a 1968 radio interview. “We say to ourselves, just because you have a superpower, that doesn’t mean you might not have dandruff, or trouble with girls, or have trouble paying your bills.”

>  “These are real people who just happen to have superpowers, as opposed to super powered people who are trying to be real,” longtime Marvel artist and writer John Byrne told Comics Feature in 1984.

>  “There’s something fundamental about the environment in which these heroes were imagined,” says Joan Hilty, a DC editor from 1995 to 2010. “All of DC’s heroes are royalty. Superman is the last son of an alien planet. Batman in a super-rich guy. Wonder Woman is a princess. Green Lantern is a top-line fighter pilot. Aquaman is the king of the sea. All of these heroes came out of the 1930s and ’40s during World Wars and a desire to find archetypes that could save entire countries. DC characters are too perfect and pegged to a different time.”

>  “All these characters are assholes,” Adams says. “They’re bad guys. They’re not heroes. All the characters at Marvel began as monster stories, and they somehow find their way to doing good stuff in their lives.”

>  But the limitations of its distribution deal with Independent continued to hamstring Marvel. Goodman and Lee were unable to introduce solo titles for their increasingly popular heroes, and the characters were instead forced to share space in a single title. Captain America and Iron Man went halvsies in Tales of Suspense, for example. Goodman’s poor distribution deal did have one silver lining that became apparent only in retrospect. It allowed a lone editor, Stan Lee, to oversee an entire line of comic books, imposing a singular vision and voice on every title. In that sense, if you liked one Marvel magazine, chances are you’d like another. Marvel was finally emerging as a cohesive brand.

>  At DC each of the editors was like his own separate brand. “From the 1940s through the 1960s DC’s editors were independent fiefdoms, never reading each others’ books and rarely using each other’s talent,” former DC editor Bob Greenberger says. As a result, each editor’s books had a look and feel that might differ from those of the guy down the hall. Marvel was different. Because Lee had been in charge of this newly emerging superhero line from its inception, he was able to build something special. A coherent universe.

>  Marvel also pioneered the idea of stories continuing stories. By 1962 Lee was becoming increasingly overworked and no longer had the time to craft tight, self-contained stories. As a cheat, he took one story and stretched it out over several issues, leaving a cliffhanger at the end of each. The idea flew in the face of standard industry practices because the haphazard nature of comic book distribution meant a customer could never be sure he would be able to find consecutive issues at his local newsstand. But the new format did not cause readers to abandon Marvel; in fact, they were being drawn deeper into this burgeoning fictional world, in some cases buying every title the company produced.

>  DC artists were forced to work within an established house style that governed the page layout as well as the look of the artwork. Editor Julie Schwartz’s motto was, “If it’s not clean, it’s worthless.”

>  “Marvel is a cornucopia of fantasy, a wild idea, a swashbuckling attitude, an escape from the humdrum and prosaic,” Lee would write, summing up what Marvel was all about. “It’s … a literate celebration of unbridled creativity, coupled with a touch of rebellion and an insolent desire to spit in the eye of the dragon.”

>  Donenfeld was dismissive. He didn’t see what Haney and Drake had seen. “We do $ 100 million a year and they do $ 35 million,” the publisher said defensively. “What was happening was the Marvel revolution, and we pointed it out to him,” Haney said. “And he didn’t recognize it.

>  The problem DC would soon face was not how many comics overall it was selling but what percentage.

>  DC released 343 individual comics that year, the most of anyone in the business (a title it would hold until 1973). Superman was the number-one title overall, and DC hogged seven of the other spots in the top ten. On the surface the publisher appeared dominant. Underneath, the numbers would begin to reveal another story. DC was tops only because it printed far more titles. The problem was, the publisher’s sell-through rate, the percentage of the print run consumers were actually buying, was shakier compared to Marvel’s. It was as clear an indication as any that their rival’s readership was smaller but far more enthusiastic.

>  Superheroes were in vogue, so Goodman asked Lee to create more of them. Lee initially teamed with Sub-Mariner creator Bill Everett for a brand-new character. But when Everett fell behind on the art chores, Lee was forced to go to plan B. Taking a page from DC’s playbook, Lee tossed together members of the company’s existing superhero roster into one powerful team, just like the Justice League.

>  Lee pitched Goodman on the series he called “The Mutants.” Goodman rejected the title, reasoning that kids wouldn’t have any idea what a mutant even was. Lee walked out of that meeting thinking, “This demonstrates how some people in big positions are idiots,” as he recounted at the 2016 New York Comic Con. So Lee went with The X-Men instead—the X standing for “extra,” as in the kids’ abilities.

>  “I [initially] reasoned that there wasn’t enough lead time for it to have been a rip-off. But back then I didn’t know that many DC artists were already working for Stan,” Drake said in 2003. “In short, from the day I dropped my first Doom Patrol script on Boltinoff’s desk, news could have leaked to Marvel about ‘a team of anti-super-heroes led by a scientific genius in a wheelchair.’ So the plagiarism issue remains open. And unless someone steps up to say, ‘Yes, one day, I told Stan about that,’ it will never close.”

>  The go-go checks did their jobs. They did distinguish DC’s books from others on the stand. Only that may not have been such a great thing. “It was the stupidest idea we ever heard,” DC’s Infantino would say of the checks, “because the books were bad in those days, and that just showed people right off what not to buy.”

>  On February 3, 1966, Drake typed a blistering, seven-page memo to Donenfeld laying out the reasons he believed Marvel was ascendant and the changes he recommended DC make to keep up. “[ Marvel] succeeded for two reasons primarily,” Drake wrote in the memo. “First, they were more with what was happening in the country than we were. And perhaps more important, they aimed their stuff at an age level that had never read comics before in any impressive number—the college level (let’s say ages 16 to 19 or 20).”

>  Donenfeld’s response to the memo was similar to his response back in 1962 when Drake and Haney had first sounded the alarm. “You’re as full of shit as a Christmas turkey,” the executive fumed to Drake. “We outsell Marvel three to one.”

>  “Everybody’s favorite guessing game these days is trying to figure out the real identity of the Sub-Mariner’s powerful penciller, Adam Austin!” Lee wrote in the December 1965 Bullpen Bulletins. Colan drew with a delicate pencil style full of lush shading, and it didn’t take long for the artist to be outed. Soon after his Marvel work began appearing, Colan got a call from a fan saying, “Don’t bother trying to fool me with that Adam Austin bit. I’d know your work anywhere.”

>  The expansion was not just about sating readers’ desire for more Marvel; Goodman had an ulterior motive for pumping up the company’s output—namely, he was laying the groundwork for Marvel to be sold. After decades in the business, churning out pulps, men’s magazines as well as comics, Goodman had grown tired and desired to spend more time with his family.

>  Improving DC’s covers was a step in the right direction, but to quote an adage from DC editor Jack Schiff, “The cover sells that month’s issue. But the insides sell next month’s.” DC’s problem in 1968 under its new owners was that the insides of its books hadn’t changed all that much.

>  “Wear a tie,” Infantino told Kubert. “We’re editors now.”

>  “When Carmine rose to power he began throwing out a lot of old freelancers,” Evanier says. “There were a lot of guys who had been working for DC since the forties, and Carmine decided that their work was stale, which perhaps it was.”

>  “You’ve got fifty-year-old men responding to the sense that we have to hip up. Horribly misguided things start happening at DC,” says former DC editor Brian Augustyn. “It was this absurd weirdness that arrives from people under the gun to try to make things cooler.”

>  “DC experimented, but without a direction,” Neal Adams says, “they had no overall plan. It was like shooting guns in the dark. They didn’t know what they were doing.”

>  One problem DC faced at the end of the 1960s was that the market for comics—and print media in general—was shrinking. Fewer outlets carried their wares, as newsstands and mom-and-pop candy stores began to disappear. The country was becoming more of a car culture, as the exodus from cities had shifted most of America’s population from the denser urban areas to the suburbs. TV also began to consume more leisure time.

>  The artist was offered any title in the Marvel stable. Literally any title. Instead of opting for Spider-Man or the Fantastic Four, Adams asked what the worst-selling title was. The answer: The X-Men. “Lee said, ‘We’re going to cancel it,’” Adams recalls. “I said, ‘Great, I’ll take it. You won’t pay much attention to me.’” Lee agreed, but then demanded that if Adams was going to work for Marvel, he’d have to leave DC behind. Adams said no and got up to leave. Before he hit the door Lee was chasing him. “Wait, hang on. It’s no problem.”

>  The most shocking thing about that debut issue didn’t come in the story pages; it came in the credit box. Following the names of Lee, Thomas, inker Tom Palmer, and letterer Herb Cooper, a line trumpeted, “And introducing the penciling wizardry of Neal Adams.” No pseudonym. No nom de plume created by combining the names of his children. Adams, one of DC’s top artists, was using his real name in a Marvel comic. And with that, the whole fake name game collapsed. Freelancers were now able to work for both companies without having to act like a spy sneaking into East Berlin.

>  “If people believe something is true, by believing it, they make it true,” Adams says. “By showing them it’s not true, that it’s just something some idiot made up, it falls apart.”

>  Weisinger had been threatening to retire for years, and each time Liebowitz would give him more money to stay. It was a great scheme—until it finally backfired. In 1970 Weisinger told Infantino, once again, he was thinking about retiring, and Infantino, who’d had enough of the editor’s ploys, replied, “Well, OK. We’ll miss you. Bye.” Weisinger was shocked. Two weeks later he even returned to the office, telling Infantino he’d reconsidered and didn’t want to actually retire. He appreciated the changes that DC had been making, and he’d like to stay, thankyouverymuch. Infantino stood firm, telling the Superman editor that his career at DC was over.

>  After three decades Mort Weisinger, the man who once compared writers to oranges—“ You squeeze them until there’s no juice left then you throw them away”—the man who most embodied DC’s conservative mindset, the man who was disliked by so many, was gone.

>  Kirby had been growing increasingly unhappy at Marvel and was especially dissatisfied with the new contract he was being offered. He was also becoming estranged from Lee, a man who had once been his errand boy but was now his boss. Kirby felt Lee was hogging all the credit for Marvel’s success, and Kirby also despaired that the company was distancing him from his creations. When a Silver Surfer solo comic had been launched in 1968, it was John Buscema who’s been tapped to pencil it, not Kirby, the character’s creator. “At DC, I’m given the privilege of being associated with my own ideas,” Kirby said in 1971.

>  “Vinnie took great pride in the fact that he solved everyone’s problem by inking a job in three days that should have taken ten days,” Rubinstein says. “He was a hero because he got the job done. One of the ways he did it was to erase backgrounds and black out figures. It’s like [artist] Gil Kane said: ‘Vinnie is the best inker in the business except for everyone else.’”

>  By today’s standards it’s all unremarkable soap-opera stuff. Back in 1971, however, the comics code forbade any depiction of drugs, even with a message as heavy-handed as the one found in Amazing Spider-Man. When submitted for approval, the Code Authority rejected the antidrug issues of Marvel’s top title. But instead of making changes or yanking the stories, Stan Lee forged ahead, publishing issues #96, #97, and #98 without Code approval. The move was a first for Marvel and any mainstream comic book—sort of like Disney releasing an NC-17 movie—and proved controversial. To Marvel’s crosstown rivals, at least. DC was aghast at what they viewed as a breach of decency.

>  The three loved the idea. Even more so after a few more drinks. But they knew it would have to be done under the table, feeling—perhaps rightly so—that the heads of their respective companies were unlikely to tolerate their fanboy idea. Seeing as how an official, editorially sanctioned crossover wasn’t possible, the writers agreed to introduce a superteam in their own comic that resembled the superteam from the other company.

>  “Len, Gerry, and I were friends, and we were sitting around, and we thought, ‘Why can’t we do something together?’” Englehart says. “And the answer was, because we worked for different companies. Then we said, ‘Well, we can solve that problem.’” The writers, absent of any clearance from their respective bosses, cooked up a storyline set in Rutland and involving Englehart’s car getting stolen. The first installment of the multipart tale ran in Englehart’s Amazing Adventures #16 (January 1973), the second in Wein’s Justice League of America #103 (December 1972), and the final in Conway’s Thor #207 (January 1973). Each story stood on its own, but when all were read together, they provided a fuller narrative.

>  A freelance artist named Frank Robbins, who’d been drawing Batman, was seeking work at Marvel, and when Marvel asked how much his page rate was, he exaggerated what DC had been paying him. Lee found out about the white lie and blew his top. He discussed the issue with Infantino over lunch, and the two executives agreed to share rates in the future. When Lee returned to the Marvel offices he told editor-in-chief Roy Thomas what had happened at lunch, and Thomas was appalled. He dashed off a memo to Lee, calling the collusion “immoral, unethical and probably illegal.” Lee asked him if he was resigning, and Thomas said yes.

>  One sticking point was money. DC initially wanted more than half the profits because they insisted Superman had a higher distribution. They also demanded that Superman’s name come first in the title, as he was the more iconic character. “That goes back to what I consider the Carmine kind of approach, and it wasn’t just Carmine; it was all the editors and people at DC. They had a very superior attitude,” says David Anthony Kraft, then a Marvel editor. “Marvel was never that stroppy. You want to have Superman’s name first? Fine. Whatever.”

>  The choice had an added advantage to Infantino and DC: drawing the crossover book would require Andru to take a break from The Amazing Spider-Man for a couple of months. The book was then Marvel’s top seller, and losing its artist might hurt sales. “You’ve got this guy who’s recently left your top-selling book to go work for the other company, and now he’s writing this big book, and he’s taking the artist on your top-selling book,” Conway says. “So there’s a bit of a screw you there too.”

>  When Wein complained to Landau about temporarily losing the artist on The Amazing Spider-Man—a comic he also happened to be writing—Landau told him the details of the Superman vs. Spider-Man assignment were none of his “fucking business.” Wein threw himself at the executive, determined to “rip out his throat” and had to be restrained by Marv Wolfman.

>  “The one quote I remember someone saying is, ‘Are you fucking kidding me?! If Superman ever hit Spider-Man, he’d knock him past Jupiter.’” “They squabbled like two old ladies,” Denny O’Neil says. Another challenge was crafting an interesting “vs.” story in which the opposing sides are both good guys. Neither company, for obvious reasons, wanted its character to look at all like a villain.

>  Conway eventually worked up a story pitting Superman and Spider-Man against DC’s Lex Luthor and Marvel’s Doctor Octopus. But before the heroes took down the villains, Supes and Spidey meet and, in a now-clichéd plot device that Marvel pioneered in the 1960s, start fighting due to a misunderstanding.

>  “Carmine was a prick,” says inker Joe Rubinstein. “Once I was at [Neal Adams’s studio] Continuity Associates, and I picked up the phone. It was [DC editor] Joe Orlando, who was such a sweet, sweet guy. He asked, ‘Is Neal there?’ I said, ‘No, he’s not.’ He proceeded to lay into me: ‘Tell that motherfucking cocksucker, blah, blah, blah.’ And then silence. And then he said, ‘Sorry, I had to do that because Carmine was in the room.’”

>  Warner executives appeared determined to go for an even bolder pick than they had made with Infantino, because they chose someone with three qualities nobody in the business was expecting. First, the new hire had no comic book industry experience. Second, the pick was a youthful twenty-eight. And third and perhaps most surprising of all, he was not a he at all. A venerable company in a field historically populated almost exclusively by men was now going to be led by a woman. Legend has it that when DC editor Joe Orlando heard the news, he immediately went to the bathroom and puked.

>  Kahn had two items on her to-do list straight out of the gate: make the comics better and, in an industry notorious for abusing its talent, start treating the writers and artists better. Easier said than done.

>  “Unless they do so well and the kids buy nothing but their books and we lose a fortune, then I’ll do it, but I don’t expect that to happen,” he said. “I have a feeling that we’ll sell more books than ever, and they’re going to fall flat on their face.”

>  The purge became known as the “DC Implosion”—a darkly humorous take-off of the DC Explosion—though the employees were careful not to utter the phrase around the office in front of executives. “The Implosion was a huge shockwave,” says artist Steve Bissette, then a student at New Jersey’s Kubert School, where classes were taught by professionals, including some from DC. “Teachers would show up to work, and their eyes would be red from crying on the train.”

>  In a way it was like DC’s more regimented system had come to Marvel. “This was wild and crazy Marvel,” says Kraft. “People would be having water pistol fights and doing pretty much whatever we wanted. And here comes Shooter out of the DC world. He set up a system where each editor has a family of books, and they have an assistant editor. He instituted that system I really despised over there.” Whether or not the staff liked the new order, it led to increased sales. Marvel’s slim lead in market share would soon balloon to double digits.

>  Much of Marvel’s rise would come on the back of one particular book, the Uncanny X-Men. The story of the mutant outcasts had ceased publishing original stories and turned to reprints in 1970. The title was revived in 1975 with a whole new set of characters, and it would soon rise to become Marvel’s best-selling title and a force in the industry. And strangely, much like Fantastic Four, it owes its existence, in part, to DC.

>  Claremont, a part-time actor, brought a knack for drama to the title. “Chris had this operatic thing that Jack Kirby might have done the best, plus a level of soap opera, plus having strong female characters, plus this basic idea of misfits hanging together, hounded and hunted by the rest of the world,” says Ann Nocenti, the Uncanny X-Men editor in the 1980s. “It was a combination of things that worked beautifully.”

>  “You know what?” Shooter responded. “Let’s invite [the DC people] over. Let them come to our meetings. They can listen to every damn word I say. I don’t give a damn what they know. We can do it, they can’t. We are better than them, and we will win.” But in 1980 DC would produce a bona fide Marvel-esque book—arguably its first since Doom Patrol in 1963.

>  “George and I always called it DC’s first Marvel book,” Wolfman says. No surprise considering that the three responsible for the Titans were “three refugees from Shooter-land,” as one magazine put it.

>  New Teen Titans may have been a massive sales success, but in the early 1980s it remained one of the lone bright spots in DC’s lineup. The comic book publisher continued to sputter, and Marvel widened its lead, doubling its rival’s circulation by June 1984.

>  The companies’ two trademark super-teams had still never gone head to head. The Avengers were going to have to battle the Justice League. On paper the project made all the sense in the world and was just another in an increasingly long line of joint efforts between Marvel and DC. In execution it turned out to be an earth-scorching disaster that left both sides longing for the relative civility of Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man.

>  But none of Marvel’s early efforts was able to capture what made their comics so special. The shows existed simply to sell “breakfast food” to “four, five, and six-year-olds,” as Lee admitted in 1974. Throughout the seventies the prevailing attitude at Marvel was that the characters weren’t worth much. Martin Goodman’s son Chip made a terrible deal to option the entirety of Marvel for just $ 2,500. A few years later, in 1976, Marvel sold the rights to twelve characters to Universal. The price: just $ 12,500. “Marvel in particular had so little understanding or belief in their characters outside the comic book world,” says former Marvel editor-in-chief Gerry Conway.

>  William Dozier, the executive producer of the 1966 Batman series, once admitted that he was embarrassed to read Batman comics in public as research. “I felt like an idiot,” he said. A 1978 Us magazine article on The Incredible Hulk promised, “It’s not a ‘comic book show,’ the stars insist.” A starchy CBS executive was quoted assuring nervous viewers, “The Hulk is not a comic book character. We attempt to surround him with mature stories and realistic people.”

>  The Superman rights had been secured in 1973 by a father-and-son producer team, Alexander and Ilya Salkind, along with partner Pierre Spengler. Poland-born Alexander had never heard of Superman before his son urged him to pursue the rights after having seen a Zorro poster on a Paris street. (The elder Salkind referred to the character as “Mr. Superman.”)

>  The director hung a banner in his office reading “verisimilitude” to serve as a constant reminder not to capitulate to the temptation that comes so easily when making a story about a man in a red-and-blue leotard. Do not devolve into parody.

>  “We had a very expensive film and a very difficult problem in marketing it,” Warner Bros. executive Rob Friedman said in 1981. “How did we convey to the public that it wasn’t a cartoon or a quickie Saturday matinee serial? How did we appeal to an adult audience without turning off the youth audience?” The campaign worked, and people of all ages flocked to see Superman when it opened on December 15, 1978. The film raked in $ 7 million its opening weekend, on its way to becoming the then-sixth-highest-grossing movie of all time.

>  “The first Superman movie had a lot of the Marvel pacing, and yet they never had that kind of stuff in the Superman books,” Stan Lee said in 1987. “I used to figure if we ever did Spider-Man the right way, the way the books have done him, people would think we were imitating Superman. You can imagine the way that makes me feel.”

>  The lack of a sales boost was a blow to the ailing industry. Sales at mainstream newsstands were continuing to shrink, as many merchants began to favor more profitable items. When a copy of Playboy and a copy of Superman took up the same amount of shelf space and a sale of the comic earned a merchant just a few cents, it became a no-brainer as to how rack space should be allocated.

>  Why overprint hundreds of thousands of copies in hopes of reaching newsstand readers when you can sell directly to the people who want your books? By most accounts the first comic book specialty store opened its doors in San Francisco’s Mission District in 1968. Owner Gary Arlington started the San Francisco Comic Book Company less as a retail venture and more as a place to store his massive comic book collection.

>  As devoted as the customers might have been, the big publishers considered sales to these stores negligible. They barely qualified as a rounding error in a business whose sole focus was the newsstand market. That would begin to change in 1973. That summer at the Comic Art Convention, a fan gathering held each summer at New York City’s Statler Hilton Hotel, one savvy dealer and a well-timed bribe would change the course of comics history and potentially rescue the industry from certain oblivion.

>  “This had never been done, bringing new comics to a convention that aren’t on the stands yet,” says comic dealer Bob Beerbohm. “He set up spinner racks and put out all these new comics, and it was like watching a piranha feeding frenzy, like a cow falling into the Amazon river.”

>  The catch was that, unlike sales to newsstand distributors, sales through Seuling would be nonreturnable. In this channel, whatever product retailers bought, they’d be stuck with, and the publisher would not grant credit for unsold issues. That single provision went a long way toward mitigating one of the riskiest elements of the business for DC. Returnability meant the publisher never had a decent handle on sales numbers, and the system was rife with fraud. Wholesalers were no longer required to return torn-off covers for publisher credit and were now simply required to sign an affidavit testifying to how many copies went unsold.

>  “Even though DC was the first one to cut the deal with Phil Seuling for direct only, it was Marvel to be the first to hire Mike Friedrich to manage it and build it,” says former DC editor Bob Greenberger. “DC’s efforts were always a step or two behind Marvel, and Marvel, as a result, was able to go gangbusters.”

>  The burgeoning direct market allowed both companies to begin using higher-quality printing techniques that were not affordable with newsstand returnability. Marvel switched from letterpress printing, an archaic method that offered low resolution and muddy art, to the crisper offset printing. DC followed suit in 1981.

>  Months of negotiation followed, and Byrne was finally hired. The news sent shockwaves through the industry. DC had, in the span of three years, managed to poach not only (arguably) its rival’s top two creators but two names who had worked nearly their entire careers at Marvel and were closely identified with the company. The shocking migration led Marvel editor Al Milgrom to quip, “DC is Marvel and Marvel is DC.”

>  In the early eighties Frank Miller, along with Steve Gerber, had pitched bold new takes on Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The proposal called for Miller to write and draw a Batman comic, which seemed a natural fit, given his dark, noir-ish work on Daredevil. The proposal was later abandoned after Gerber walked away, but Miller kept his notes, hoping to one day put them to use. In 1985, as the artist’s thirtieth birthday loomed two years in the future, Miller began thinking about Batman’s age—a perpetual twenty-nine—and how unsettling it would be for Miller to one day find himself older than the hero he’d been reading since childhood.

>  Miller’s story introduced a fifty-year-old Bruce Wayne who has retired following the murder of sidekick Robin at the hands of the Joker. He’s driven to don the cape and cowl again to battle a violent gang that has taken over Gotham. Later he tangles with Superman—portrayed as a Reagan-era sellout now working for the government—and the homicidal Joker.

>  DC was playing a longer game, attempting to champion projects that would elevate the medium and have a shelf life longer than four weeks. “Quality became the motivation,” as one editor put it. “We were firmly convinced that the direct market would be the heart of the business for a generation and that readers would be older and more sophisticated and be prepared to pay more,” Paul Levitz says. “We felt we should move towards more creator-driven passion projects that pushed the limits of what we’d done before and see where we could go with it.”

>  Those series, as The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen before them, helped push the medium and attract a more diverse audience to comics. The new direction led to the rise of the “DC Zombie,” a counterpart to the evangelical Marvel fanboy who bought exclusively from one company. “Such creatures were almost nonexistent in the early ’80s since few people knew DC was still publishing,” fanzine Amazing Heroes reported in 1990. “With DC’s latest comeback, Zombies have cropped up.”

>  “Doing Dark Knight as a trade paperback, in retrospect, was one of the most important things I did in my career,” says Paul Levitz. “We largely created that business. The trade paperback changed the game.” Other blockbuster collections followed, including one of Watchmen. Graphic novel sections are now a part of most every bookstore.

>  Batman, starring Michael Keaton and directed by Tim Burton, finally arrived in June 1989, notching the biggest opening ever at the time. The flick quickly raced past $ 100 million on its way to becoming the highest-grossing movie of the year. The movie was notable for many reasons, not the least of which was that it finished the mission that Superman had started more than ten years earlier, once and for all proving that moviegoers would line up to see straightforward superheroes movies.

>  But Batman’s most enduring legacy may not be at the box office; it would be in the realm of merchandising. Batman was a trailblazer in licensing and cross-promotion, as Warner Bros. set out to exploit the hell out of every possible revenue stream in an orgasmic frenzy of intracompany synergy.

>  wanted to meet you. You have the highest-selling books,’” says former Uncanny X-Men editor Ann Nocenti. “Then he apparently walked down the hall and said to somebody, ‘Well, if things with an X sell, why don’t you put an X on everything?’ He didn’t understand the product. He didn’t understand that you couldn’t stamp an X on every book and that they’d sell.”

>  Marvel under Perelman began to take aggressive steps to increase profits. In May 1989 Marvel jacked the cover price of standard comics from 75 cents to $ 1 and was pleasantly surprised when no noticeable decrease in sales followed.

>  Marvel’s other strategy was simple: release more product. More product in stores meant more money.

>  “I mean, fuck, I didn’t let some little thing like not being able to write stop me, so I didn’t really see where that should actually be that much of a problem,” the artist said in 1992. “I just wanted to test to see how much balls people had.”

>  The aggressive strategy was paying off for Marvel. After just two years under Perelman’s new management, the company’s profits had jumped tenfold, which was especially good news, as Marvel had gone public in July 1991.

>  DC’s marketing chief worried that there was no way so many copies would sell through to the consumer, so he borrowed an idea from the book industry. Some paperbacks at the time were printed with multiple covers in an ingenious bid to obtain multiple front-facing (as opposed to spine) placements in bookstores. Printing a book with different covers meant it occupied more shelf space and was more visible, so buyers were less likely to overlook it.

>  The idea that comic books were collectibles that would increase in value dated back to at least the 1960s when Newsweek wrote an influential article on comic fandom and noted, to the author’s shock, that a copy of Superman’s first appearance in Action Comics #1 was selling for an astronomical $ 100. (A copy went for $ 3.2 million in 2014.) Suddenly everyone had visions that the stack of Aquamans collecting dust in their garage could be worth big money.

>  “The Death of Superman” would prove to be the high point of the era. The comic book market peaked in April 1993, then dropped the next month and continued spiraling downward.

>  The bubble was bursting. The comic shops that had cropped up to capitalize on the hype soon found themselves stuck with product they could not sell and were deeply in debt. They began to close their doors. By the end of the decade the number of specialty stores had dropped by 75 percent, according to some estimates.

>  The Malibu acquisition would not turn out to be Marvel’s most catastrophic of the decade, however. It wouldn’t even be the most catastrophic of the year. That honor would go to the company’s December 1994 purchase of Heroes World, the country’s third-largest comic book distributor, located in New Jersey.

>  Prior to the deal comic book shops could buy Marvel comics from multiple distributors. The Heroes World acquisition meant that if a retailer wanted Marvel comics—still the lifeblood of the industry, despite the publisher’s recent decline—they would be forced to buy from a single distributor at whatever terms Marvel established.

>  But as the second-biggest publisher, DC was suddenly in a position of power, able to field offers from distributors desperate to handle its business. In 1995 the company announced it had chosen Diamond as its exclusive dealer to the direct market. The choice essentially killed off the other distributors who could no longer survive without DC or Marvel products. DC’s contract was reported to have come with one interesting caveat: in the event of the death or retirement of Diamond’s owner, or after ten years, DC had the option to buy Diamond outright. DC’s insistence on the clause looked shrewd in 1995. Two years later it looked absolutely genius. That’s when Heroes World collapsed for all the reasons insiders expected, leaving Marvel without a distributor and forcing the publisher to come crawling back to the only option left: Diamond.

>  Marvel continued to struggle with slowing sales and mounting debt. In December 1996 Perelman filed for bankruptcy protection. For longtime comic book readers the news was akin to being told Strawberry Shortcake had cancer, an unwelcome intrusion of harsh reality into a beloved fantasy world.

>  While DC continued to enjoy its cushy corporate existence, Marvel was bent to Perlmutter’s penny-pinching ways, compounding the misery many felt working in a dying industry. Perlmutter killed the company Christmas party and got rid of the office’s free coffee machine. He chastised employees for not photocopying on both sides of a sheet of paper, and was known to make the rounds in the office after hours to dig through the staff’s trash, looking for perfectly good paper clips that had been thrown away. He’d then leave the clips in little piles on the offender’s desk. “He called me in once to justify why [editor] Tom Brevoort was on the phone with [artist] Carlos Pacheco, who lived in Spain, for an hour?” says former editor Frank Pittarese. “Well, Carlos was drawing the Fantastic Four. ‘They got to talk for an hour?!’ he’d ask.”

>  If Survivor and The Real World and other popular shows at the time have taught us anything, it’s that conflict equals audience engagement. “I liked it when the two companies hated each other,” Quesada said in 2002. “It made it better for the fans. You know, if you like DC, then you hated Marvel. If you like Marvel, then you hated DC.” “Bill had come from sports, and he had that instinct of team rivalry,” says Stuart Moore, a former DC editor who went to Marvel in 2000. “He wanted to stir up the fans to root for one side or the other. And he really liked to tweak the DC people, who had a tendency to take themselves a bit seriously. He loved to taunt them. He was into causing trouble.”

>  “Those who love him say it’s because Levitz wants to shield his creators and characters from the commercial exploitation and corruption that could come from mass media exploitation,” Jemas continued. “Those who loathe him say Levitz is a man with teeny talents, who keeps the industry tiny to protect his own power over truly bright and talented creators.”

>  Jemas and Quesada’s methods may have turned off some in the industry, but much like Simon Cowell hurling nasty put-downs on American Idol, readers seemed to eat them up. The new management began pulling Marvel out of the bankruptcy doldrums, helping the comic book business as a whole, which, in recent decades, had been overly dependent on Marvel. One year after Jemas and Quesada came to power, the industry reversed seven straight years of decline to register modest growth.

>  At the time one of the biggest mysteries in the Marvel universe was the origin of Wolverine, the ultra-popular, virtually indestructible member of the X-Men. Only fragments of his backstory had been revealed over the character’s twenty-five-year history, in part because no one knew what it was. (An unproduced 1984 X-Men screenplay by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway said Wolverine had been given his metal skeleton after a car accident.) Editorial was also fearful that telling the story would ruin the character. All it took was a financial shortfall to change all that. “One time one of our financial guys came into me and Jemas, and he said a couple projects had fallen off the table,” former Marvel publishing operations director Greenberger says. “He said, ‘We’re going to have an $ 800,000 shortfall this year if we don’t do something.’ That’s when Jemas said, ‘Well, I guess it’s time to do Wolverine’s origin.’”

>  Quesada let rip with a series of digs at DC that would drive a nearly irreparable wedge between the companies and chill relations—perhaps for all time. “What the fuck is DC anyway?” Quesada railed in the Observer piece. “They’d be better off calling it AOL Comics. At least people know what AOL is. I mean, they have Batman and Superman, and they don’t know what to do with them. That’s like being a porn star with the biggest dick and you can’t get it up. What the fuck?”

>  Superhero movies have definitely brought these characters to another stage. They’re now the hottest thing going, with a popularity that shows few signs of diminishing. The genre raked in some $ 1.9 billion in 2016 alone and accounted for nearly 17 percent of movie market share (compared to just .3 percent twenty years earlier).

>  Of the projects that did make it to the screen, Marvel probably wished they hadn’t. Howard the Duck, released in 1986, was Marvel’s first modern-day big-screen adaptation, and the title earned just $ 16 million domestically against a $ 36 million budget. It was such a spectacular loser that it supposedly led to a fistfight between two Universal executives over who was to blame.

>  The comic book adaptation that kicked off the modern-day obsession is a movie that many don’t even realize is from a comic book. Men in Black, the 1997 Will Smith–Tommy Lee Jones blockbuster, was adapted from an obscure black-and-white comic published in 1990 by indie press Aircel. Aircel was later acquired by Malibu, which was then bought by Marvel in 1994.

>  “Don’t ever forget that the movie that changed everything was a black-and-white pick-up,” artist Steve Bissette says. “That changed the paradigm away from all Marvel being able to get was a Hulk TV series and an awful Dr. Strange TV movie. Everything they’d been aching to do with movies for decades was suddenly possible, and it was possible because of something they had accidentally acquired.”

>  The conventional wisdom since has been that Marvel made a terrible deal for the property—a mistake that was only magnified over the years as the X-Men under Fox went on to unimaginable financial success. But the price—$ 1.5 million and 5 percent of the gross receipts per movie, according to a copy of the deal dated July 1993—was reasonable. At the time comic book properties were commanding around $ 100,000 to $ 200,000.

>  The problem for Marvel came with the contract’s language. Rights contracts are usually written with ridiculous specificity to try to define exactly what the buyer is getting. The language in this particular contract, according to sources, was too broad and ended up transferring a larger-than-expected swath of Marvel’s intellectual property to Fox. In short, instead of a limited number of X-Men, the movie studio ended up landing the rights to all things mutant in the Marvel universe in perpetuity.

>  “Marvel figured out that we’d rather hang out with flawed characters who were nonetheless spiritually uplifting heroes rather than the dark, self-loathing, and haunted DC characters,” says Jeff Most, a Hollywood producer whose credits include the comic book adaptation The Crow.

>  “That’s not my idea of what I want to see in a movie,” Downey said. “This is so high-brow and so fucking smart, I clearly need a college education to understand this movie. You know what? Fuck DC Comics. That’s all I have to say, and that’s where I’m really coming from.”

>  The DC tent is large enough to accommodate multiple interpretations, and it may be better off for it. Audience members who are turned off by Snyder’s cinematic murderverse can simply switch on the TV for versions of the characters they might like more. The approach provides more flexibility to tell different kinds of stories. It also makes it easier to switch up something that isn’t working.

>  Meanwhile Marvel has taken the exact opposite approach, opting to set all its TV and film projects (except the licensed ones) within the same universe. The company is hoping that if you enjoyed The Avengers, then you’ll tune in to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., the ABC series starring Clark Gregg, the actor who also plays Agent Phil Coulson in the movies.
