> Silicon Valley is to the United States what the United States is to the rest of the world. It is one of those places, unlike the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but like Las Vegas, that are unimaginable anywhere but in the United States. It is distinctively us.
The new new thing is a notion that is poised to be taken seriously in the marketplace. It’s the idea that is a tiny push away from general acceptance and, when it gets that push, will change the world.

> Progress does not march forward like an army on parade; it crawls on its belly like a guerrilla.

> was looking, it appeared, straight up at the sky. What he was looking for, no one could say. Probably he was thinking about something he might like to change. Possibly he was not thinking at all but groping. That is how his mind worked—the logic always came after the initial, inexplicable, primal impulse.

> By then I knew that the only way to spend time with Jim Clark was to leap onto one of his machines. You didn’t interact with him so much as hitch a ride on the back of his life.

> Machines! He loved to know about them, to operate them, to master them, to fix them when they were broken. More than anything he liked to upgrade and improve them. I came to believe they were the creatures in the world to whom he felt closest. They were certainly the only ones he really trusted.

> If anything, Clark used his machines not to impress other people but to avoid them.

> Back in 1921 Veblen had predicted that engineers would one day rule the U.S. economy. He argued that since the economy was premised on technology and the engineers were the only ones who actually understood how the technology worked, they would inevitably use their superior knowledge to seize power from the financiers and captains of industry who wound up on top at the end of the first round of the Industrial Revolution.

> New Growth Theory argued, in abstruse mathematics, that wealth came from the human imagination.
> The metaphor that Romer used to describe the economy to noneconomists was of a well-stocked kitchen waiting for a brilliant chef to exploit it. Everyone in the kitchen starts with more or less the same ingredients, the metaphor ran, but not everyone produces good food. And only a very few people who wander into the kitchen find entirely new ways to combine old ingredients into delightfully tasty recipes. These people were the wealth creators. Their recipes were wealth.

> But the world breaks down neatly into people who can look at a control panel and know instinctively what it all means, and those who can’t.

> Essentially, Clark taught himself by trial and error. He’d poke buttons and push levers, seemingly at random, to see what happened next.

> Irritation, for him, was not an ordinary low-level emotional event. Along with its brother, impatience, irritation was the sensation

> The role model for this activity was Jim Clark. This was due not so much to Clark’s success as to his talent for self-reinvention.

> Not Clark. Other people grew old, he stayed new. His psyche was a magic show, and this was its favorite trick: no matter how long he’d been around, he could behave as if he’d just arrived.

> Eventually, I saw a kind of logic in his grazing: this was how he left himself open to accident. If nothing surprising or interesting was happening to him, he moved on until the situation corrected itself. This was as true of his work as of his leisure; indeed, it was hard to say where the work stopped and the leisure began. They formed a seamless, disturbing pattern of motion and change.

> As a practical matter, Clark had no past, only a future. That’s when he really came alive: when you got him on the subject of what was going to happen next. Then he was full of ideas, and they would change from one moment to the next.
> That sort of grand talk struck him as perfect bullshit. In all the time I spent with him, I never once heard him refer to his ability to see the future. He couldn’t see it—that’s why he had to grope for it. He would be seized by some overwhelming enthusiasm—say, his ambition to create a new field of study that he wanted to call biocomputing, or his newest idea for snaring more billions in the World Wide Web—and he would be off and running down some long, dark tunnel leading God knew where.
Usually, after a week or two, Clark would decide there was something wrong with his new idea, and drop it. Moments after he’d exploded with his latest plan to create another multibillion-dollar industry, he would have forgotten about it. But every now and then the long, dark tunnel didn’t come to a dead end.

> The few times I asked him directly how he had got from there to here—which, it was becoming clearer, was the same as asking how the modern world had got from there to here—he would offer some perfunctory reply and wave me away. “That’s boring,” he’d say. When I pressed he might say, “That’s the past. I really don’t give a shit about the past.”
When I asked him about the article in the Plainview paper, all he said was “I grew up in black and white. I thought the whole world was shit and I was sitting in the middle of it.”

> In the Navy, Clark said, he learned that his desire for revenge could lead to success. He was propelled in the classroom by his anger about the humiliation he’d suffered at sea. Thus success, for him, became a form of revenge.

> “It was one of those times when the whole fucking world went berserk,” he said. “After my wife left I went into this spiral…six months of counseling. Then I said fuck counseling; it wasn’t helping anything. There was all of this self-actualization stuff around, est and that kind of thing. I thought I don’t need some guru to tell me how to find my way out.” “So it was as simple as that?” He laughed. “No. For a year and a half I was in this kind of down-beat funk. Dark, dark, dark.”

> In something like an instant the man had changed his life. He reinvented his relationship to the world around him in a way that is considered normal only in California. No one who had been in his life to that point would be in it ten years later. His wife, his friends, his colleagues, even his casual acquaintances—they’d all be new.
> An actual human being read these tests, presumably looking for the fellow stupid enough to circle “morbid” and “evil.” When the true Organization Man read NAKED, he underlined “nude,” even if he thought “evil.”

> The chip Clark had designed, the Geometry Engine, was better able than any before it to process three-dimensional graphics in real time, and so create a simulation of reality on the computer screen. “Jim’s logic was that the world was three-dimensional, and so the computer world would have to be, too,” said Kurt Akeley, one of Clark’s students. “He thought the right way to interact with the machines is the way you interact with the world.”

> For instance, an engineer from Lockheed visited Silicon Graphics (SGI) soon after the company was founded. The SGI engineers offered him a demonstration: an automobile depicted and manipulated in three-dimensional space on an SGI computer. “That might be good for designing cars,” said the man from Lockheed, “but I design airplanes.”

> It didn’t take long for Clark to become deeply irritated by the rules of American capitalism. In his opinion, the game was rigged so that the people who really mattered got the shaft. He believed in his bones that the people who mattered most were the brilliant engineers: the chefs who cooked up the new recipes.

> Moore’s law, which stated that the price of computing power would fall by half every eighteen months, implied that the pyramid must collapse. The PC would soon be able to perform all the functions of a Silicon Graphics work station. Microsoft controlled the market for personal computers through its operating system, and so Microsoft would displace Silicon Graphics. Microsoft and Silicon Graphics sold shares in themselves to the public the same year, 1986. Silicon Graphics might have been stunningly successful, but Microsoft was taking over the world. “You could see a time when the PC would be able to do the sort of graphics that SGI machines did,” says Clark. “And SGI would be toast. Eventually, Microsoft would take over its business.”

> In December 1990 he joined a discussion at a conference called PC Outlook. One of the questions the panel considered was “Will personal computing and personal communications be combined, or will it just remain as science fiction?”

> Fred Kittler, then an analyst with J. P. Morgan, recalls visiting Clark in his office at SGI in early 1990. “I was out here with a couple of analysts, and he was pacing back and forth like a man in a prison cell complaining about how his board wouldn’t let him create his cheap computer. It was clear by then he had no real power.”

> Clark thought that Silicon Graphics had to “cannibalize” itself. For a technology company to succeed, he argued, it needed always to be looking to destroy itself. If it didn’t, someone else would.

> Teaching his boat to sail itself diverted his mind from the fact that others, not he, were about to inherit the earth. On his boat he could think about how to inherit the earth from its current heirs.

> In computing, a monopoly took the form of a toll booth. Bill Gates had his toll booth, the PC operating system. Jim Clark wanted his own toll booth.

> The general idea hardly originated with Clark. Back in the late 1970s the corporate ancestor of Time Warner, called Warner-Amex, had created a pilot for an interactive television in Columbus, Ohio, called Qube. Qube was supposed to let cable TV viewers send messages to the networks, and request the programs they wanted to see, via remote control. But the machine didn’t work particularly well, and it cost a fortune to build. The company spent $30 million trying to build it, and then quit. Then there was an idea, called Videotext, cooked up by researchers at the British post office, also in the 1970s. It hooked a black box between the telephone line and the television set and enabled people to send messages to each other while they watched the BBC. Nobody wanted that either. A few years later AT&T and Knight Ridder came together to deliver the newspaper each morning to the masses on their television set. The masses yawned and went back to bed.

> In a warehouse behind the Computer Museum just north of San Jose, for instance, stands a gleaming red four-feet-high computer built by Honeywell in the mid-1960s. The Kitchen Computer, it was called. The Organization Man’s housewife was meant to program her recipes into it. “If only she could cook as well as Honeywell can compute,” read the ad in the Neiman Marcus catalog. The computer was premised on the dubious assumptions that every American housewife would (a) want a massive computer in her kitchen and (b) know how to program it. Neiman Marcus failed to sell a single unit.

> would go out, and I would just say all this shit to reporters,” he recalls. “And they’d print it! And people inside SGI started to talk about it. And I thought, ‘Fuck Ed McCracken. I can say whatever I want. And by God if I go out and talk about it enough, Ed won’t have any choice but to build it.’”

>  “How would you like to build the world’s first interactive television set?” he asked. He explained that Ed McCracken had come around to Jim Clark’s way of thinking, but did not like the idea of Clark’s having his own company.

> “As a pure engineering challenge,” says Marco Framba, another engineer on the project, “it was more difficult than any I’ve ever heard of.” Jim Chiddix at Time Warner says, “It required more lines of computer code than was required to put a man on the moon.” Pavan and Kittu were told that they had eighteen months to build the new machine. They said it would take them twenty-four. It took them twenty-three.

> “We solved a problem that was not that important to many people. I’m not terribly proud of what we accomplished. We started out to change the world. Did we change the world? No fucking way.”

> “Jim said right out, ‘I’m going to make $100 million.’ And I said, ‘That’s great, Jim,’ and also something about how pleased I was with the way SGI had worked out. And then I said, ‘But even if it hadn’t worked out, I’ve had a great time, met great people, learned a lot.’ And Jim got mad. He said, ‘No! If I go and do this next thing and don’t make $100 million, it’ll be a failure. I’ll be a failure.’ And that’s kind of the way I remember leaving it with him.”

> Success was his chosen form of revenge.

> But its fabulous stock market success created a precedent. No longer did you need to show profits; you needed to show rapid growth. Having a past actually counted against a company, for a past was a record and a record was a sign of a company’s limitations. Never mind that you weren’t actually making money—there’d be time for that later, assuming someone eventually figured out how to make money from the Internet. For the moment you needed to plow all of your revenues back into growth. You had to show that you were the company not of the present but of the future. The most appealing companies became those in a state of pure possibility.

> The speed with which Clark had made himself and a lot of other engineers rich created new forces of greed and fear in Silicon Valley. Microsoft was twelve years old before people started talking about Microsoft millionaires; Netscape was one and a half.
Suddenly, all of these were overshadowed by stock options. The engineers who went to work for Netscape were no different from you. And yet…they—not you!—were getting rich. Worse, they were the B team. The A teams of engineering had been, in general, too well treated by their companies to take a flier on what appeared, from a distance, a doubtful new venture.

> Many of the people who thought him a genius just a few years earlier now thought him a fool. “At the time I thought Jim was just brutal with Ed,” says Dick Kramlich, who negotiated McCracken’s golden handshake. “Now I think Jim was just right.”

> That experience had pretty much shattered Pavan’s faith in pure technical virtuosity, or what he called “the religion of technology.” Great technical success had proven to be a great commercial failure. “Just a bunch of engineers solving problems,” as Pavan put it, derisively.

> The lesson Pavan extracted from the bitter experience was to watch what Jim Clark did, not what he said.

> Kittu was fascinated that such a technically minded person could be so happy groping blindly toward big piles of money. “Jim Clark has a clarity of vision that is prompted by the purest form of greed,” says Kittu. “Nothing clouds it.”

> Watching the B team of computer science whooping it up down the road after the Netscape public offering enraged him. “I’ll tell you what I knew on the day Netscape went public,” he says. “I knew two things. I knew my next company would be a start-up. And I knew that anything smaller than Netscape was unacceptable.”

> Kittu’s manager accused him of plotting to steal other engineers. “And so,” recalls Kittu, “I just said, ‘Fuck you, I resign.’”

> One morning at eight Clark showed up on his motorcycle to have a look around. He noticed Panos, a Greek engineer, tucked behind his computer work station. He said, “You’re here early.” Panos looked up and said, “I never left,” and went back to work.

> “It was three am,” he recalls. “I’m sitting there drinking espresso, listening to music, and writing up some notes about the software and…I could never explain this to anyone…not even my wife…I was so happy. I just laughed to myself.”

> Clark liked to say that human beings, when they took risks, fell into one of two types, pigs or chickens. “The difference between these two kinds of people,” he’d say, “is the difference between the pig and the chicken in the ham-and-eggs breakfast. The chicken is interested, the pig is committed. If you are going to do anything worth doing, you need a lot of pigs.”

> company at zero, he did not imagine they would object. Long called the venture capitalists with Clark’s proposal. Their sense that Healtheon was worth very little warred with their fear that Jim Clark knew something they did not. Somewhere deep down they realized how bad they would look if Healtheon by some miracle became an enormous success, and Clark made off with it all. Almost before they knew what they had done, they threw their money on the table—eight million dollars. Clark supplied the other twelve million himself.

> Clark took a different approach. He said with some conviction: I know how to make a lot of money in the future. And since I know how to make a lot of money in the future, I am going to put all my money on it.

> That was the burden of the technical man. He knew the many ways technology could fail. And he realized that he alone was responsible for its success.

> One of the many things Mike Long had learned in the transition from Serious American Executive to keeper of the new new thing was to keep the story moving along. Or, as he put it, “You have to stay ahead of the public road map.” The minute investors understood what you were doing, they held you in lower estimation.

> To woo investors enamored of the new—and thus keep your stock price rising—you had to remain in a state of pure possibility.

> People who are unhappy with the way things are tend to remain unhappy even after they have changed them. The nature of their unhappiness is such that change does not slake it.

> The difference with Clark is that he continued to believe in the endless possibilities of change, even after he’d experienced its limitations. He was the least happy optimist there ever was.

> Hazel continued, “I remember him telling me when he came back from the Navy, ‘Mama, I’m going to show Plainview.’”
