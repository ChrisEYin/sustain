>  The teacher returned the assignment with a note that read, “This was awfully gross. I don’t think it needs to be that way.” Romero got a B + for his artistic efforts.

>  priced devilishly at $ 666.66.

>  The book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution was a revelation.

>  “You can’t keep programming into the future on the same machines,” Romero told Al. “I want you to know that I do not know the PC but I’ll learn it really fast.”

>  “I think we can do that. That’s still not a great amount of time, but we could probably do something decent, but I’m going to need a team: an artist, a couple programmers, and a manager, because I don’t want to sit there interfacing with management all day; I want to program.”

>  Because the tiles were in memory, they could be quickly thrown up on the screen without having to be redrawn. Carmack called the process “adaptive tile refresh.”

>  An early and apparent difference between the Two Johns’ internal human engines was the way they processed time. It was the kind of difference that made them perfect complements and the kind that could cause irreparable conflict. Carmack was of the moment. His ruling force was focus. Time existed for him not in some promising future or sentimental past but in the present condition, the intricate web of problems and solutions, imagination and code.

>  All of science and technology and culture and learning and academics is built upon using the work that others have done before, Carmack thought. But to take a patenting approach and say it’s like, well, this idea is my idea, you cannot extend this idea in any way, because I own this idea—it just seems so fundamentally wrong. Patents were jeopardizing the very thing that was central to his life: writing code to solve problems.

>  Carmack listened, but Al’s words didn’t compute. He was looking into the face of the past, of opportunities unrealized, of all the old authority figures who had ever stood in his way. As always, he was blunt to a fault. “I don’t care about them,” Al would recall Carmack replying. “I’ll go back to making pizzas before I stay at this crummy place.” On February 1, 1991, id Software was born.

>  In the late 1980s, Scott Fisher, an engineer at the NASA–Ames Research Center, combined a head-mounted display and data-transmitting hand gloves in what became the archetype of the virtual reality interface.

>  The possibilities of virtual realities, it appears, are as limitless as the possibilities of reality. They can provide a human interface that disappears—as a doorway to other worlds.”

>  his focus was not on chipping away at some grand design of such a virtual world but, rather, on solving the immediate problem of the next technological advance. He

>  Carmack read up on the topic but found nothing adequate for his solution. He approached the dilemma as he had in Keen: try the obvious approach first; if that fails, think outside the box.

>  To get the computer to draw at the fastest possible speed, Carmack tried another nontraditional approach, known as raycasting. Instead of drawing out a large slab of graphics, which required a lot of memory and power, raycasting instructed the computer to paint a thin vertical strip of graphics at a time, based on the player’s point of view. The bottom line: raycasting meant speed.

>  Released in April 1991, Hovertank was the first fast-action, first-person shooter for the computer. Id had invented a genre.

>  He wrote a program that could temporarily save or cache an image on the screen so that it didn’t have to be redrawn every time a character passed by. To create the illusion of depth, he realized that he could temporarily save two images together, say, a little section of a sidewalk and a little chunk of a tree in the background, for quick recall.

>  “Story in a game,” he said, “is like a story in a porn movie; it’s expected to be there, but it’s not that important.”

>  Carmack’s first innovation was just to think up the idea of diminished lighting. But, equally important, he was willing to make the difficult choices that would make this technology possible. That meant letting something go.

>  He urged game developers to “understand their role in a nurturing society.” Senator Lieberman took it as a call to arms. “After watching these violent video games,” he said, “I personally believe it is irresponsible for some in the video game industry to produce them. I wish we could ban them.”

>  I wish we could ban them.”

>  “What happens to this kind of business when the data superhighway arrives? . . . No sales force, no inventory costs, no royalties to Nintendo or Sega, no marketing costs, no advertising costs, no executive parking spaces. This is a new and exciting business model, not just for games, and not even just for software, but for a host of products and services that can be sold or delivered via an electronic underground.”

>  Tonight, Carmack watched the guy in the “Wrote It” shirt walk out the door.

>  This belief has existed since ancient Greece, when Plato said, “Every man and woman should play the noblest games and be of another mind from what they are at present.” In the fifties, the anthropologist Johan Huizinga wrote that “play . . . is a significant function . . . which transcends the immediate needs of life and imparts meaning to the action. All play means something.” He suggested a new name for the human species: “Homo Ludens,” Man the Player. Marshall McLuhan wrote in the sixties that “a society without games is one sunk in the zombie trance of the automaton. . . . Games are popular art, collective, social reactions to the main drive or actions of any culture. . . . The games of a people reveal a great deal about them. . . . [They] are a sort of artificial paradise like Disneyland or some Utopian vision by which we interpret and complete the meaning of our daily lives.”

>  “To win the game,” the voice bellowed, “you must kill me, John Romero.” With another blast of the rocket, the Icon of Sin was dead.

>  Despite all his work on DirectX, he still felt like Microsoft was treating his project as “skunk work.” On one occasion, he received a call from an incredulous superior who simply said, “Tell me why I shouldn’t fire you.” Judgment Day would show them all the answer. But to succeed, he knew that he needed to unveil not only the games but the man himself: Bill Gates.

>  Twenty elite gamers had been flown in and were competing under a giant screen that showed the game. The two top contenders—a stealth Asian American teenager nicknamed Thresh and a Floridian beach bum nicknamed Merlock—twitched over their PCs as they fought. The crowd gathered around them, cheering and taunting. Thresh won the match and was besieged by fans and reporters. “Oh my God,” Jay Wilbur said to himself, looking on in disbelief, “this is a

>  sport.”

>  But the id installation had a bit more in store: an eight-foot-tall vagina.

>  There was no cohesive plan.

>  “You have to give yourself the freedom to back away from something when you make a mistake,” Carmack said. “If you pretend you’re infallible and bully ahead on something, even when there are many danger signs that it’s not the right thing, well, that’s a sure way to leave a crater in the ground.

>  That was when it really hit Romero: We’re not of a single mind anymore.

>  So when id negotiated to retain shareware rights for Quake, GTI’s Ron Chaimowitz didn’t think much of it. He would regret that choice. Mike pitched the id guys on a new way to capitalize on the shareware plan. Instead of just distributing Quake shareware over the Internet for free, id could sell a CD-ROM containing both the shareware and an encrypted version of the full game. Someone would buy the shareware for $ 9.95, then could call up id directly and pay $ 50.00 for the code to unlock the complete game. As a result, id, despite not owning the retail publishing rights to Quake, could succinctly cut GTI out of the equation.

>  As far as everyone was concerned, Carmack had just passed the torch. It

>  By the summer of 1997, Dallas had become to gamers what Seattle was to musicians in the early 1990s; id was Nirvana.

>  Many game developers are in it only for the final product, and the process is just what they have to go through to get there. I respect that, but my motivation is a bit different. For me, while I do take a lot of pride in shipping a great product, the achievements along the way are more memorable. I don’t remember any of our older product releases, but I remember the important insights all the way back to using CRTC wraparound for infinate [sic] smooth scrolling in Keen (actually, all the way back to understanding the virtues of structures over parallel arrays in apple II assembly language . . .). Knowledge builds on knowledge.

>  I wind up catagorizing [sic] periods of my life by how rich my learning experiences were at the time.

>  “Romero is chaos and Carmack is order,” he said. “Together they made the ultimate mix. But when you take them away from each other, what’s left?”
