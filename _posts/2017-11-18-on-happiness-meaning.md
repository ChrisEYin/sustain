I’ve been thinking more about happiness recently. Mostly I've been asking myself questions like, "What is happiness?", "Why is it important?", and "How does one be happy?" These felt like simple questions, but I found my own answers to be shallow & incomplete. 

So I thought I would try to better define what happiness means to me. And in the process, hopefully also identify some basic principles about happiness that I can use to help me make better decisions. 

But why did I even care about this? I've been working on a number of things this year and I have a few large(ish) life decisions in front of me. I like several of my options, so I wanted to try and avoid any short term thinking and optimize my decisions for long term happiness. 

__So what is happiness?__

Happiness can be a pretty nebulous (and subjective) concept. You ask 10 different people about what makes them happy and you'll get 10 different answers. But the [dictionary definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness): happiness is a mental or emotional state of well-being.

The type of happiness that we most commonly hear or talk about is short term happiness. I'm happy with my outfit, a big promotion, a new car, etc. These are mental states driven by externalities -- something happened to you and it affected your mood in a positive way. 

While not a bad thing, the main problem is that short term happiness is fleeting. It always fades away and repeated exposure to the same stimulant has a diminishing effect over time (i.e. A new car makes you happy when you first get it. 1 year in, now it's just a car. 5 years in, and any other car on the road looks better.) 

Because of its impermanence, we're forced to keep chasing an idea of happiness without ever attaining it. So perhaps a better goal is long term happiness. And to better describe long term happiness, I've been using the below:

* Happiness = Present
* Contentment = Past + Present
* Meaning = Past + Present + Future

__Contentment__

> "I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires, rather than in attempting to satisfy them." - [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill)

Contentment can be seen as the opposite of happiness. It's a sustained positive state of mind driven from the inside. So instead of being happy about your new car (temporary & external), you might be content because you've kept your diet for the last year (sustained & internal).

The key is removing desire. This idea has many fathers, but let's use [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism). Buddhism tells us that the root of human suffering comes from the craving of impermanent states & things. Only by letting go of our desires and wants will be able to attain true happiness.

The beauty of this is that it helps us go from [passenger to driver](https://zenhabits.net/the-incredible-power-of-contentment/). If happiness comes from the inside, then each of us has the power to control our happiness -- regardless of what happens to us on the outside. 

__Meaning__

Satisfaction and happiness in life is often correlated with meaning. And so that begs the question -- what is meaning?

A way to think about this is through [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle). In [Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics), he writes that the path to [eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) (read: fulfillment) is through performing activities that exhibit virtue (read: excellence). In his view, human beings achieve eudaimonia by engaging in work which they will achieve the most success in.

[Jordan Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson) frames [meaning as](https://youtu.be/Bi-RT1jYP_A?t=9m06s) "aim[ing] at the highest possible good that you can conceive." [Martin Seligman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman) stated that [in a meaningful life](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/theres-more-to-life-than-being-happy/266805/) "you use your highest strengths and talents to belong to and serve something you believe is larger than the self."

The above leads me to believe that meaning is about potential. Meaning is about understanding your potential and then striving to live up to it. This struggle helps provide a sense of direction and guides you through life. 

__Advice from above__

While researching, I stumbled across [a post](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/06/karl-pillemer-interview-no-2/) from [Farnam Street](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/) about [30 Lessons for Living](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452298482/), a book written by [Karl Pillemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pillemer). In it, Karl interviews older folks and asks them to dispense advice for younger people. 

The core idea behind the advice given was that life is short. Although ~80 years can feel like a long time, in practice, most felt like it flew by them. A few highlights from the interview:

* Stop wasting time and use it more carefully.
* You are much more likely to regret what you didn’t do than what you did.
* Happiness is a choice – not a condition.
* Choose a job for intrinsic not monetary rewards.
* Stop worrying.

__Takeaway__

There's a lot I left out. Happiness in all its forms is a huge topic. And I haven't even begun to fully understand it all. 

But from what I read, it seems we have to start with contentment. Letting go of our desires will lead us to internal harmony. And once we've achieved that, then we can focus on discovering and fulfilling our meaning.
