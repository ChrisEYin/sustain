I recently ran across this thread from [Anil Dash](https://twitter.com/anildash) on Twitter. He's riffing off of a different thread from [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993560378129960960) on paid acquisition & CAC. From that, Anil draws out an insight about the current state of SaaS. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a really great thread. An important thing to understand: you get unsustainable paid-acquisition SaaS companies because of overinvestment in particular players in a market, but that still raises CAC for the other companies in the market, even if they *were* sustainable. <a href="https://t.co/mRYDoQh1Wo">https://t.co/mRYDoQh1Wo</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/994200404597661696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

I suspect there's truth in this. I can think of several sectors that feel overfunded -- there far too many companies playing relative to the TAM. In turn, these companies now have to spend far more money to stand out amidst the deluge of sales & marketing spam. But the amount of money said customer is spending hasn't actually gone up. Hence, the aforementioned problem. The HR & recruiting space comes to mind.

But one of the tweets in his thread drew my attention and caused me to wince a bit. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a good articulation of the business case for going for winner-takes-all in SaaS. The downside here, though, is categories where “winner” = “best at raising VC”, not “best product”, and markets where there’s little or no competition. <a href="https://t.co/gQcnnFJWe8">https://t.co/gQcnnFJWe8</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/994339888089714692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

Without getting into the argument of "winner = best at raising VC" (I disagree), the part that caused me to wince was the subtle implication that the best product *should* be the winner. 

We often hear founders & entrepreneurs talking about a company's product relative to the success of that business. Some variation of "I can't believe they're going public, the product isn't even that good!" or "They have a great product, they'll easily take the whole market." 

This is classic Silicon Valley bias -- overindexing on what we're good at. There is still a strong aversion to anything sales & marketing related and a strong emphasis on product & engineering. Largely because we just don't like sales & marketing (it's not scalable!) and engineering is more rational & logic based. And so the silicon valley startup folklore is to spend more time on product & engineering and ignore the other 'slimy' parts of business, sales & marketing. 

To be clear, I'm not knocking product & engineering -- I work in product and am certainly a believer that product & eng is the cornerstone of any successful company. What I am saying though is that this view of 'the best product should always win!' is misguided at best, lazy or self-delusional at worst. 

While we'd all like to live in a hyper rational place in which all the things are assessed objectively and the best wins, that's not even remotely close to reality. Customers are ultimately just people -- and so they're subject to all the same biases & messiness of real people. Meaning -- they're not rational at all and *gasp* -- might make decisions based on emotion!

In reality, people buy things because their friends tell them to. They buy things because they're "cool". They buy things because they liked what the sales person was wearing that day. And the list goes on (see [Predictably Irrational](https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248) for more on this). The net of it -- the customer isn't rational. And so the "best product" won't always win. The fact your product might be "better" may not even matter to them!

Again, not to knock product. You have to have a good enough product to even compete. But what you should understand is that product is just one part of what a customer is buying. To succeed you have to deeply understand your customer's actual motivations for buying a product. And you have to then understand the end to end customer journey from initial interest, consideration set, how/when they evaluate success, etc. to make sure you're actually positioning yourself for success (see [Jobs to be Done](https://jtbd.info/) for more). Otherwise you're just being lazy and hiding behind your own competencies instead of truly thinking about how to best reach & serve your customers.
