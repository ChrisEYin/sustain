I'm always looking for analogies from different industries that I can learn from and apply to startups / venture. And the more I read about the entertainment business, the more similarities I see. 

So I recently read [Blockbusters](https://www.amazon.com/Blockbusters-Hit-making-Risk-taking-Business-Entertainment/dp/B00JV50YUG/ref=pd_cp_14_4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=0M0R8K4V2K1H5SJ2W3A7). To be honest this is one of those books that should probably be a blog post. But it does make a few interesting points. 

The core of the book is that Hollywood is largely driven off blockbusters, or big concentrated wins. All the revenue in the business comes from a few big winners, and everything else is done in service of these winners. 

> One of the essential lessons - the surest way to lasting success in show business - is to bet heavily on likely blockbusters and spending considerably less on the “also rans”.

Just as in Hollywood, the [vast majority](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/the-meeting-that-showed-me-the-truth-about-vcs/) of returns in venture come from just a handful of investments. In the music business, record companies usually make their money back on 1 out of every 5 or 6 albums. In venture, [3 of 4 startups fail](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190) to return investor money and for those that do return, you need to average [7.5x on those](http://avc.com/2009/03/what-is-a-good-venture-return/) (for an early stage firm).

So the cost of missing a big winner is much greater than the cost of losing money on a few smaller deals. And so the investor's point of view, the question is not *is this a viable business*, but *can this be a huge business that can grow quickly*. Similarly, it's not about *how good the music is*, but *how big is the audience base and how quickly can it catch on*.

So why do big firms do indie movies or smaller productions at all? Why not just focus on making a few large concentrated bets per year and the ignore the smaller films?

> Pursuing a wide range of smaller projects allows studios to form closer links with agents, who are involved in the lion’s share of deals for new products and therefore critical gatekeepers. And going for smaller-scale products can enable entertainment companies to build and maintain a favorable critical reputation as well, which in turn can help them attract sought-after A-list talent and their projects.

This reminds of when I hear investors saying they're investing in order to 'build a relationship'. Similar to those in the entertainment business, larger investors sometimes do smaller deals to know the founder, show the market they invest in that stage / space, or to build a relationship with others investors (upstream, downstream or those in the round).

These bets are really more marketing driven than a true investment that they're hoping to get a return from. And so for founders, it's important to learn and recognize which is which. It can be frustrating to work with a firm that you think is partnering with you when they really view you as a marketing expense. 

But there is also a business in smaller bets. For example, a music executive, [James Diener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Diener), started [Octone Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26M_Octone_Records) so he could focus on 'earlier stage' artists.

> The idea was simple. Octone would focus its efforts on just a few artists each year. Initially, the company would rely heavily on grassroots marketing campaigns to gradually build the artists' fan base. But once artists were on the verge of breaking through, the company's distribution & marketing would enter a second, more aggressive phase. To make this possible, Octone structured a partnership with Sony BMG Music Entertainment.

Octone's goal is to discover & build up early stage talent. Their focus allows them to invest more heavily in the needs of early stage artists and act as sa bridge to help them get to the next level. And so for those that do break out, these firms have relationships with the later stage firms (in this case Sony) to help take their artists to the next level.

In startups, we have both accelerators & pre-seed funds. YC, Angelpad, Mucker Labs, Alchemist, Acceleprise, and other incubators play a similar role. They're built on the idea that they can invest very early, get a great valuation, and help build & bridge their companies to the next stage.

And finally, as in both venture & entertainment -- 

> “The great artists and the bad artists are easy—it is the good artists that can kill you.

So given the similarities, is there anything else we can learn from Hollywood? A lot of possibilities -- from the talent / agent model, the studio / funding model, the decoupled process of idea / creation / distribution, etc. 

Will save my opinions for another post :).
