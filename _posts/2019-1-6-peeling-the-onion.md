I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. It’s a simple, but deeply important idea. However, I see a lot of people failing to really understand this and apply it to their lives. Particularly for high performing folks, there seems to be a tendency to toil away in private to perfect whatever it is they're working on. They’re so focused on doing a great job that they don’t pick up their heads enough to check in and make sure they’re going down the right path.

I still find myself making this mistake at times. When I’m doing something new or trying to impress someone, I over-optimize for perfection. I'll focus on going super deep on my own, trying to figure out every nook & cranny while losing sight of the original goal. 

Another place this happens to me is when I'm reading. I used to open a book and read it front to back. But sometimes I would get stuck or lose interest. And because we're _supposed_ to finish books we read, I wouldn't pick up another book until I finished this first one. So my backlog continued to grow, but my progress slowed to a halt. 

This even happens to me when I'm just researching or reading things on the internet. Any time I want to learn about a particular topic, I'll do a quick search & open up dozens of tabs on it. After a quick scan, I tell myself I'll go deep into it later and do the proper research. Of course, I rarely find the time and similar to reading -- the backlog grow and progress slows. 

The cause is the same in all of them. I was mistakenly viewing things with a binary lens. There's was only a perfectly done project or nothing. A book was only read front to book or not read at all. And I either knew a topic all around or I didn't. This mindset does the same thing in every situation it hampers my progress because I'm so focused on "finishing" that I never get anything done.

The reality is that that nothing is ever really "done". You never finish anything, you just go deeper and deeper into it. You don't need to go from zero knowledge about something to being a world expert. All you need to do is incrementally improve. Don't boil the ocean and get distracted -- focus on just getting 1% better than you were before. This forces you to continuously make progress instead of getting caught up in a stasis and hoping for perfection.

The way I think about all of this is by viewing everything as an onion. Instead of trying to go all the way in immediately, focus on just peeling back layer by layer. If you're starting a new project, don't start by going deep into research -- start by putting together a high level outline. If you're reading a new book, don't feel the need to go page by page from beginning to end -- start with the TOC and read the interesting chapters or passages. Once you understand the outermost layer, then you go to the next layer or you can just stop.

It reminds of what Annie Duke talks about in [Thinking In Bets](/books/thinking-in-bets/). It's not about figuring out the right move, it's simply about improving your odds. So remember to see the layers of the onion in everything you do, and go down layer by layer. You'll get more done, waste less time, and feel better about everything you do.
