>  After an unpromising start, the more slices we took, the more rectangular the shape became. But it was only in the limit of infinitely many slices that it became truly rectangular. That’s the big idea behind calculus. Everything becomes simpler at infinity.

>  We can often solve the problems we’re working on by fantasizing that we can actually reach the limit and then seeing what that fantasy implies. In fact, many of the greatest pioneers of the subject did precisely that and made great discoveries by doing so. Logical, no. Imaginative, yes. Successful, very.

>  There’s a general lesson here: Limits are often simpler than the approximations leading up to them. A circle is simpler and more graceful than any of the thorny polygons that approach it. So too for the pizza proof, where the limiting rectangle was simpler and more elegant than the scalloped shapes, with their unsightly bulges and cusps.

>  To see why, suppose we entertain the thought, just for a moment, that a circle is indeed an infinite polygon with infinitesimal sides. How long, exactly, are those sides? Zero length? If so, then infinity times zero—the combined length of all those sides—must equal the circumference of the circle. But now imagine a circle of double the circumference. Infinity times zero would also have to equal that larger circumference as well. So infinity times zero would have to be both the circumference and double the circumference. What nonsense!

>  For many practical purposes, the discrete can stand in for the continuous, as long as we slice things thinly enough. In the ideal world of calculus, we can go one better. Anything that’s continuous can be sliced exactly (not just approximately) into infinitely many infinitesimal pieces. That’s the Infinity Principle. With limits and infinity, the discrete and the continuous become one.

>  To get a feel for the level of precision we’re talking about here, consider how many digits we would need to make one of the most extreme comparisons imaginable. Take the largest possible distance, the estimated diameter of the known universe, and divide it by the smallest possible distance, the Planck length. That unfathomably extreme ratio of distances is a number with only sixty digits in it. I want to stress that—only sixty digits. That’s the most we would ever need to express one distance in terms of another.

>  His other distinguishing stratagem was blending mathematics with physics, the ideal with the real. Specifically, he mingled geometry, the study of shapes, with mechanics, the study of motion and force. Sometimes he used geometry to illuminate mechanics; sometimes the flow went in the other direction, with mechanical arguments providing insight into pure form. It was by using both strategies with consummate skill that Archimedes was able to penetrate so deeply into the mystery of curves.

>  This argument gave Archimedes a lower bound on what we would call pi, written as the Greek letter π and defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of the circle.

>  By using a 96-gon inside the circle and a 96-gon outside the circle, he ultimately proved that π is greater than 3 + 10/ 71 and less than 3 + 10/ 70.

>  between the sixth and the fourth centuries BCE, somebody proved that the diagonal of a square was incommensurable with its side, meaning that the ratio of those two lengths could not be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. In modern language, someone discovered the existence of irrational numbers. The suspicion is that this discovery shocked and disappointed the Greeks, since it belied the Pythagorean credo. If whole numbers and their ratios couldn’t even measure something as basic as the diagonal of a perfect square, then all was not number. This deflating letdown may explain why later Greek mathematicians always elevated geometry over arithmetic. Numbers couldn’t be trusted anymore. They were inadequate as a foundation for mathematics.

>  With its yin and yang binaries, pi is like all of calculus in miniature. Pi is a portal between the round and the straight, a single number yet infinitely complex, a balance of order and chaos. Calculus, for its part, uses the infinite to study the finite, the unlimited to study the limited, and the straight to study the curved. The Infinity Principle is the key to unlocking the mystery of curves, and it arose here first, in the mystery of pi.

>  He came up with a brilliant idea—brilliant because it established a rule, a consistent pattern that held from one level of the hierarchy to the next. He imagined sliding the oblique line at the base of the segment upward while keeping it parallel to itself until it just barely touched the parabola at a single point near the top.

>  Next, Archimedes invoked known geometrical facts about parabolas and triangles to relate one level of the hierarchy to the next. He proved that each newly created triangle had one-eighth as much area as its parent triangle.

>  There’s a shortcut to sum this kind of infinite series, which is known in the trade as a geometric series. The trick is to cancel all but one of its infinitely many terms by multiplying both sides of the equation for Area by 4 and subtracting the original sum from it. Watch: Multiplying each term by 4 in the infinite series above gives 4 × Area = 4( 1 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄16 + 1⁄64 + · · · ) = 4 + 4⁄4 + 4⁄16 + 4⁄64 + · · · = 4 + 1 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄16 + · · · = 4 + Area The magic happens between the next-to-last line and the last line above. The right-hand side of the last line equals 4 + Area, because the original sum, Area = 1 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄16 + · · · , has, like a phoenix, been reborn in the terms following the 4 in the next-to-last line. So 4 × Area = 4 + Area.

>  In other words, the parabolic segment has 4/ 3 the area of the big triangle.

>  As Sherlock Holmes later put it, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”

>  How many slices of cheese, total, would each of them get to eat if this were to go on indefinitely? One way to look at it is to keep a running tally of how many slices each person gets. After round one, each gets one slice. After round two, when the quarter slices are passed out, each person has accumulated 1 + ¼ slices. After round three, when the quarters are themselves quartered into sixteenths, the running total for each is 1 + ¼ + 1/ 16 slices. And so on. Loosely speaking, each of the three people would eventually get to eat 1 + ¼ + 1/ 16 + . . . slices in total if the cutting went on forever. And since this amount must represent a third of the original four slices, it must be that 1 + ¼ + 1/ 16 + . . . equals one-third of 4, which is 4/ 3.

>  As he says, “It is easier to supply the proof when we have previously acquired, by the method, some knowledge of the questions than it is to find it without any previous knowledge.” In other words, by noodling around, playing with the Method, he gets a feel for the territory. And that guides him to a watertight proof.

>  This is such an honest account of what it’s like to do creative mathematics. Mathematicians don’t come up with the proofs first. First comes intuition. Rigor comes later. This essential role of intuition and imagination is often left out of high-school geometry courses, but it is essential to all creative mathematics.

>  What is the Method, and what is so personal, brilliant, and transgressive about it? The Method is mechanical; Archimedes finds the area of the parabolic segment by weighing it in his mind. He thinks of the curved parabolic region as a material object—I’m picturing it as a thin sheet of metal carefully trimmed into the desired parabolic shape—and then he places it at one end of an imaginary balance scale. Or, if you prefer, think of it as being seated at one end of an imaginary seesaw. Next he figures out how to counterbalance it against a shape he already knows how to weigh: a triangle. From this he deduces the area of the original parabolic segment.

>  I hope I’ve managed to convey what an acid trip of an argument this is. Instead of a potter reassembling shards, here Archimedes is more like a butcher. He takes the tissue of the parabolic region apart, one vertical strip at a time, and hangs all these infinitesimally thin strips of flesh from a hook at S. The total weight of all the flesh stays the same as it was back when it was an intact parabolic segment. It’s just that he has shredded the original shape into lots of vertical, stringy strips, all hanging from the same meat hook.

>  Archimedes is open about this. When he needs to, he can dress up his proofs in respectable garb, sporting finite sums and the method of exhaustion. But in private, he’s dirty. He admits to weighing shapes in his mind, dreaming of levers and centers of gravity, balancing regions and solids line by line, one infinitesimal piece at a time.
