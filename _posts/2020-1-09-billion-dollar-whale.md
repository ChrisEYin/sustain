>  We realized the amazing life of Jho Low was too incredible to fit neatly into the pages of the Wall Street Journal. By writing a book, we hoped to show in detail how Low did it, but also what drove him, and how he got away with it for so long. That larger portrait, about capitalism and inequality, told through the life of Low, would be of enduring value, we agreed.

>  The majority of Malaysia’s 30 million people were Muslim Malays, who typically treated the Chinese as newcomers, even if their families had lived in Malaysia for generations. Some of the older Chinese of Penang began to wonder about this strange kid. After Low’s Harrow friends had come and gone, the story of the photos began to circulate around the island, as did Low’s claims to an aristocratic lineage. People laughed over the sheer chutzpah. Who did this kid think he was?

>  Despite his elite school, Larry made a disastrous investment in the 1980s in cocoa plantations that almost wiped out the family wealth. After commodity prices dropped, he used what was left to buy a minority stake in a company that produced clothes for export to the United States and Europe. This time Larry hit the jackpot.

>  People who worked with Larry considered him charming and a wheeler-dealer, albeit with a lazy streak, preferring drinking late in nightclubs to work, but he benefited nevertheless from a run-up in the garment company’s stock.

>  Flush with cash, Larry, now in his forties, indulged his desire to party. For one celebration on a yacht, he arranged for Swedish models to fly into Penang, the kind of arrangement for which his son later would be known. The family was a big fish in a small pond—and acting the part. Larry drove around town in a Lexus, and was a member of the Penang Club, an exclusive sports club founded by the British in 1868 and whose members included well-known business families and politicians from the island.

>  Some of the most powerful Malaysian politicians owned homes in the Kensington Green development, and Larry sensed it could only be beneficial for an ambitious family like the Lows to develop friendships with these people. He bought an apartment in the complex, and the family began to vacation there, which gave Low the opportunity to meet the children of Malaysia’s elite.

>  Larry’s alertness to status seemed to rub off on his sons, who began to forge a friendship with Riza Aziz, a college student whose family also had a place in Kensington Green. Riza’s stepfather was Defense Minister Najib Razak, who was tipped as a future prime minister.

>  On another occasion, he procured the letterhead of the Brunei Embassy from his friend and forged a letter to Chinawhite, the famous nightclub near Piccadilly Circus that in the 1990s was one of the city’s hottest spots. In the letter, supposedly from staff at the embassy, Low asked for tables to be reserved at Chinawhite for members of Brunei’s royal family. The gambit worked, and Low and his underage friends went partying alongside Premier League soccer players and models.

>  Low majored in finance rather than dry macroeconomics, but he wasn’t planning on a regular banking career. The Malaysian worked hard in his first year—he was a quick study with a prodigious memory—but he began to see Wharton foremost as a place to socialize and build his contacts.

>  For sure, he enjoyed partying, and he liked having pretty women around, but more than anything this was an investment, one that made him appear successful and indispensable. That was why, ahead of the night in Shampoo, he had made an ostentatious request: The fliers for the party should have JHO LOW emblazoned in big letters next to those of the sororities. Low handed out two types of invites, standard and VIP, promising a complimentary “premium open bar,” and with details of shuttle buses from campus to the club. He intuitively understood that people desire to feel important, part of an exclusive club, and he played on it.

>  But even with his father’s backing, Low was stretched to afford the cost of the night at Shampoo. Unknown to his guests, he had put down only a portion of the costs up front and later stalled on paying the balance to the club’s owners, haggling for months before finally settling on a steep discount.

>  Low even wrote Ivanka Trump, then a student at Wharton, inviting her to attend. Low told his friends she declined the offer on the grounds she would never set foot in one of her father’s “skeevy” casinos.

>  But it wasn’t just that the analysis was faulty; many bankers had fallen for Enron’s lies. Low had plagiarized entire sections of his piece, word for word, from a Salomon Smith Barney report. He wrote many more such pieces, copying most of them from analyst reports on Wall Street. Somehow this got past editors at the paper, and Low began to develop a reputation as a stock picker, despite being only a freshman with zero experience analyzing companies.

>  But Mubadala was novel: Rather than simply invest oil profits, securing them for future generations, the fund was borrowing from global markets and actively trying to move the economy in new directions. What Low saw in Abu Dhabi planted a seed in his mind. Malaysia had a sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional, but nothing like Mubadala.

>  His father, Abdul Razak, tried to instill an old-fashioned morality into Najib and his four younger brothers. When the boys asked for a swimming pool at the prime minister’s official residence, their father rejected the proposal, lecturing his children on how a public servant should not use state funds for personal pleasure. But Abdul Razak died young, when Najib was only twenty-two, and with him any restraining influence also vanished.

>  The experience had exposed Rosmah to wealth from a young age but also instilled in her a sense of insecurity, of not truly belonging to the aristocratic world she inhabited, according to people who know her. Fascinated by royalty, Rosmah reportedly eyed members of Brunei’s royal family for marriage before she met Najib in the 1980s. She was working for a property company and he was a chief minister. They married soon after, a second union for them both.

>  But by the mid-2000s Rosmah’s spending had reached new extremes, even for Malaysia. One story that made the rounds involved her breezing into a Hermès store and informing the clerks of the few items she did not want to buy, before ordering one of everything else.

>  To finance her penchant for luxury items, Rosmah was pilfering the state coffers. One Malaysian businessman detailed how it worked: He would buy properties from state-owned companies before selling them at a markup to other state firms, sharing the profit with Rosmah.

>  Using the bank’s money, he decorated the office, sparing no expense. The space featured an “island” boardroom in the center of the floor, with glass that frosted over at the touch of a button. A whiteboard inside printed out whatever was written on it. In the restrooms, the toilet seats adjusted automatically to the height of the occupant. There was even a wading pool for tired feet. For Malaysia at the time, this was more than cutting-edge technology: It was the most luxurious office space in the country.

>  Low was at a low ebb. After failing to pay the rent on the Petronas Towers office for several months, he had to give it up. Rather than getting him close to Najib’s family, his efforts appeared to be in vain. “They had disdain for him,” one close aide of Najib said of Low. But Low was tenacious and resourceful, using every failure as an opportunity.

>  The Iskandar land project, with a big investment from the Middle East, offered Low a chance to show his worth. The young Malaysian told the politician about the deal, and offered for Najib to take credit for it—all without having to do the legwork. The Iskandar project, right on Singapore’s doorstep, would burnish Najib’s credentials as a doer, a politician who could attract investment and finally propel Malaysia into the ranks of developed nations.

>  But there was a problem. Low had expected to make serious money for himself from the deal, and he was incensed when Khazanah turned down his request to be paid a broker fee. Run by professionals, the fund was too clean for Low’s purposes.

>  But he had been blocked. To get the payoff he believed he deserved, and to repay Ambassador Otaiba, Low would do whatever it took. He came up with a convoluted yet brilliant scheme. Malaysia was abuzz over Mubadala’s plans for the giant Iskandar project. With blueprints calling for new roads, homes, malls, and industrial developments, builders would be jockeying to win lucrative contracts. At this time, Low heard about two Malaysian construction companies that were for sale. Perhaps he could buy them cheaply, and win contracts on the Iskandar development?

>  As a vehicle to make the purchase, Low set up a British Virgin Islands entity called the Abu Dhabi-Kuwait-Malaysia Investment Company and gave free shares to Ambassador Otaiba and minor aristocrats from Kuwait and Malaysia. He was creating the impression that prominent individuals were behind the company. With such illustrious backing now in place, Low had no trouble persuading Malaysian banks to lend tens of millions of dollars.

>  For the next step of his scheme, Low set up two shell companies in the Seychelles. The firms—ADIA Investment Corporation and KIA Investment Corporation—appeared, given their names, to be related to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or ADIA, and Kuwait Investment Authority, or KIA, two of the most famous, multi-billion-dollar sovereign wealth funds in the world. But the look-alike companies were purely Low’s creation, with no links to Abu Dhabi or Kuwait.

>  He was hungry for success, and despite his gifts there were signs of a willingness to cut corners. In 1993, while employed at J.P. Morgan, Leissner acquired a doctorate in business administration from the University of Somerset. The college, which closed down a few years later, was known for selling degrees for a few thousand dollars, especially to Americans looking to burnish their credentials with a certificate from a serious-sounding British institution.

>  Najib had grand ambitions to turn Malaysia into a developed nation within a few years, and for that he would need a major source of capital. Low persuaded him it would come from Arab nations.

>  But he had another selling point, one which Najib, who was ambitious, found extremely attractive: Why not also use the fund as a political-financing vehicle? Profits from 1MDB would fill a war chest that Najib could use to pay off political supporters and voters, restoring UMNO’s popularity, Low promised. On the surface, such spending by 1MDB would be packaged as “corporate social responsibility,” to borrow a phrase from the corporate world. The fund’s charitable arm would award scholarships and build affordable housing in areas where UMNO needed votes. On top of that, Low told Najib that Middle Eastern nations, through their investments in the fund, would come to see Malaysia as a coveted ally in Asia, and also back Najib’s administration with a flow of political donations.

>  Prince Turki was just the kind of figure Jho Low was seeking out: a bona fide Saudi royal to dazzle the newly installed Prime Minister Najib, but one whose need for cash made him malleable.

>  Despite the confusion, Deutsche sent two wires around 3 p.m., one of $ 300 million to the joint venture’s new account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) and another of $ 700 million to the mysterious account at Coutts in Zurich.

>  What if someone caught on? Did Low have a deeply thought-out plan about what to do when someone noticed the financial hole? The events of the past month had happened at a rapid pace, and he was ad-libbing. It was an opportunistic move, and Low had pulled it off. Like he had always done, Low would rely on his ability to think on the fly.

>  His was a scheme for the twenty-first century, a truly global endeavor that produced nothing—a shift of cash from a poorly controlled state fund in the developing world, diverting it into the opaque corners of an underpoliced financial system that’s all but broken.

>  Lawyers, unlike bankers, don’t have to conduct due diligence on a client. Details of transfers through IOLTAs, meanwhile, are protected by lawyer-client privilege. While it is illegal for lawyers to abet money laundering, they are not required to report suspicious activity to regulators. The Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based intergovernmental group that sets standards for stopping fraudulent use of the global finance system, has highlighted the United States’s poor oversight of lawyers as a weak spot in its defenses against money launderers.

>  On October 21, 2009, Low wired $ 148 million from the Good Star account in Switzerland to an IOLTA account at Shearman in New York, part of a staggering total of $ 369 million that would enter such accounts at the law firm over the next twelve months. The reasons Low gave for the transfers, noted on wire documents, ranged from property purchases to deals to buy companies. But at first, he simply used this money to fund endless rounds of partying.

>  Between October 2009 and June 2010—a period of only eight months—Low and his entourage spent $ 85 million on alcohol, gambling in Vegas, private jets, renting superyachts, and to pay Playmates and Hollywood celebrities to hang out with them.

>  Now in their midthirties, the pair were native New Yorkers who had known each other since working as club promoters while still in high school. Strauss, who is tall and lean with a permanent tan, and Tepperburg, who is heavyset with a shaved head, made an odd couple, but they were nearly inseparable. After college, they began opening clubs in the Hamptons and New York. They realized clubs lived or died on who attended, and built databases of celebrities and big spenders.

>  Low was partly a calculating showman, but he struggled to be present in the moment. He was afflicted by a deep-seated compulsion that drove him to spend more, acquire more, and move incessantly. Once, he went to a mall to get juice and returned home with eight identical pairs of black shoes.

>  Ahead of the visit, he sent an email to the Obaids to stage-manage the trip, asking that Saudi royals use words like “personal,” “trust,” “friendship,” and “bond” in discussions with Najib and Rosmah. Saudi authorities did better than that, conferring the kingdom’s top civilian award on Najib during his visit. It was the kind of honor that went a long way with the prime minister, and it showed that Low had deep connections.

>  These new restrictions, coupled with an anemic U.S. economy, low interest rates, and a weak stock market, led Blankfein to double down on his push into emerging markets. China continued to grow at double-digit rates, and the economies of Brazil, Russia—even small Malaysia—were humming along. In a speech later in 2010, as Goldman licked its wounds from the damage the crisis had done to its reputation, Blankfein said the biggest opportunity for the bank was to be “Goldman Sachs in more places.”

>  The transaction in Sarawak was the first time Leissner, the relationship banker, had joined forces with Vella, the derivatives whiz, to deliver a major amount of money to a client, quietly and fast, while making large profits for Goldman. It was a formula that would be central to Goldman’s future relationship with 1MDB.

>  “This is a fucking scam—anybody who does this has stolen money,” Belfort told Anne, as the music thumped. “You wouldn’t spend money you worked for like that.”

>  Goldman was preparing to launch what it internally dubbed Project Magnolia, a plan to sell $ 1.75 billion in ten-year bonds for the 1MDB fund. But some board members were alarmed by what Leissner had informed them: Goldman would likely make $ 190 million from its part in the deal, or 11 percent of the bond’s value. This was an outrageous sum, even more than Goldman had made on the Sarawak transaction the year before, and way above the normal fee of $ 1 million for such work.

>  “Look at your number, not at our number,” he said cajolingly.

>  In fact, Goldman already had lined up mutual funds in South Korea, China, and the Philippines to buy the bonds. The sale was handled quietly, and one Goldman employee was told to keep all correspondence about the bond off email. If word got out Goldman already had buyers, its profits would not seem justified.

>  Goldman’s internal committees, set up to catch fraud, had failed in their job. Those arguing in favor of the deal cited the imprimatur of Malaysia’s government and the role of Prime Minister Najib in 1MDB. But there was another—unspoken—reason to make this happen. The profits would make this one of Goldman’s biggest paydays of the year.

>  As the Goldman bonds came together, engineers from the shipbuilding firm Lürssen in Bremen, Germany, were putting the final touches to Topaz, Sheikh Mansour’s 482-foot yacht, which cost more than $ 500 million and was as large as a floating hotel, with two helicopter pads and eight decks. Al Qubaisi handled the financing for the Topaz, raising a large loan from Deutsche Bank that required payments of 6.4 million euros a month—a considerable outlay. One of the first payments Al Qubaisi made from Vasco, after receiving money from 1MDB, was a 6.4 million euro transfer to Deutsche Bank—an installment on the Topaz loan. He’d later pay a total of $ 166 million of the payments with funds from Vasco.

>  Yet it was so much worse than the public knew. Low had taken graft to new levels, risking Malaysia’s financial stability. The 1MDB fund’s debt stood at a whopping $ 7 billion, and it had few assets to show for the huge borrowings. Most of the money had been diverted, and the fund had crashed to a $ 30 million net loss in its latest financial year. But most of these details were kept secret. It was even hard to get a copy of the fund’s financial report.

>  To hide the origin of the money, Low used an old trick, getting his associate Fat Eric to set up an offshore shell company called Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners. This firm was designed to look like a bonafide subsidiary of the Blackstone Group but was controlled by Fat Eric, who worked for Low.

>  Soon after, Low became nonexecutive chairman, Asia, for EMI Music Publishing and joined the firm’s advisory board. In an instant, the position at EMI gave him serious credentials in the music industry, elevating him from the status of a simple rich party boy and gambler. This was his big play. A media empire would generate profits to pay money back to 1MDB. In the first two stages of the heist, Low had simply taken about $ 3 billion—and spent wildly.

>  There was a more practical element to the showmanship. As well as the stars, a number of Middle Eastern royals, including a Dubai prince, had come on board for the party. These royals had all the money in the world, but even they could not access the kind of crowd Low was able to muster—and the Malaysian understood that this was his edge. By delivering Hollywood to them, he was gaining prestige for himself with these powerful Middle Eastern figures—and, he hoped, opening the door to future deals.

>  Although he kept his name out of the press and avoided the set, Low continued to deepen his relationship with DiCaprio as filming progressed. At one point during production, the Malaysian spent more than a week at the Venetian in Las Vegas, accompanied at times by DiCaprio, Riza, and McFarland. He told friends he liked the quietness of the gambling floor, where cell phones are prohibited, as it allowed him to escape. The paid-for gambling excursions also helped reel in the actor.

>  Low, Riza, and McFarland also began to mimic aspects of DiCaprio’s lifestyle. An avid collector of movie posters, the actor introduced Riza to Ralph DeLuca, a New Jersey–based dealer in film memorabilia, and the Red Granite principals began to use money taken from the 1MDB funds to acquire millions of dollars in collectibles from him. In October 2012, Riza paid DeLuca the huge sum of $ 1.2 million for an original film poster for Fritz Lang’s 1927 silent film Metropolis, which he hung in his private office at Red Granite.

>  “I have decided—I have to own these. Its [sic] a must. Not to mention a 1000 others… Can’t sleep—obsessing,” he wrote. “Hahaha now you feel my pain!! Mwahahahaha—$ $ $ $,” Riza replied. “I’m obsessing over posters… we are such neurotic obsessive creatures… WE HAVE TO OWN THEM ALL,” McFarland retorted.

>  “I got a friend, you know he got some money, and he flew me, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and some other cats, and we flew to Australia right. And we did the countdown in Australia, then jumped back on a plane and then did the countdown in Vegas. That’s crazy! That was nuts!”

>  In the end, Goldman shrugged off Wong’s concerns. It wasn’t as though BSI was on any blacklist for money laundering. In a presentation for 1MDB and Aabar, Goldman set forth what it understood its client’s key objectives to be in the deal making. They included “maintenance of confidentiality during execution” and “speed.” In other words, this was to be a fast and secret deal—although no one at 1MDB ever bothered to explain why these conditions were necessary.

>  With the buyer’s premium—a commission charged by Christie’s—the price tag came to $ 48.8 million, a record for a Basquiat painting.

>  No one except Low knew how much he had taken over the past four years, and even he was stretched to stay on top of it: more than $ 1.5 billion from the PetroSaudi phase from 2009; $ 1.4 billion from the first two Goldman bonds in 2012; and now over $ 1.2 billion more. On top of this, over $ 1 billion in loans from the pension fund for Malaysia’s civil servants to a 1MDB unit called SRC International had gone missing. More than $ 5 billion in funds, one of the largest-ever financial frauds, and it wasn’t over yet. More than a billion had been frittered away, more than a billion went into property and businesses, and more than a billion was used to pay off the prime minister and other conspirators.

>  While Swiss bank secrecy had been eroded, the Geneva Freeport did not have to list its clients. A Swiss art warehouse owner called Yves Bouvier, who was involved in the Geneva Freeport, in 2010 opened a similar fortress for the rich in Singapore, near Changi airport. The New York Times dubbed these entrepôts the “Cayman Islands of the art world.”

>  In all, between May and September 2013, Low, via Tanore, bought $ 137 million in art. But Low had picked up more via other channels, such as the van Gogh, as well as works by Lichtenstein, Picasso, and Warhol, and by the end of the year he possessed art worth an estimated $ 330 million.

>  At this critical stage, Low could have deployed these funds to fill financial holes, especially the nonexistent cash in the Cayman Islands. Instead, he used the bulk of the money to pay for the superyacht, which was delivered in the summer. At this late stage, with politicians and journalists clamoring for the Cayman Islands money to be returned to Malaysia, it was irrational to be exacerbating the financial damage at the fund.

>  Two days later, more than $ 100 million was diverted to a shell company controlled by Fat Eric. It became clear from what occurred next why Low needed to keep pilfering the till: There were just so many people to repay for their services. The shell company sent $ 13 million to Densmore, a British Virgin Islands firm partially controlled by Otaiba, which had an account at BSI in Singapore, an apparent reward for using his ambassadorial position to help get the Middle Eastern banks on board. Khadem Al Qubaisi, who was Al Husseiny’s boss, got $ 15 million.

>  It was the craziest plan to date, so outlandish it appeared to have no chance of success. The idea was to transfer a portion of cash from the latest Deutsche Bank loan into the Cayman Islands fund. From there, 1MDB would then “redeem” this money, but immediately send it into a series of offshore vehicles set up by Amicorp, until the cash ended up back at the Cayman Islands fund. From here, 1MDB could again “redeem” the money. It was the same cash going in circles. The perpetrators sent a chunk of a few hundred million dollars through this cycle, and then repeated the process five more times, making it look as if 1MDB had redeemed $ 1.5 billion of its nonexistent Cayman Islands investment.

>  Since 2008, Rosmah had spent at least $ 6 million using credit cards—her husband’s, but also others in her own name—in a nonstop round of shopping stretching from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, to Harrods in Knightsbridge, to Saks on Fifth Avenue. In private, she thought nothing of using government jets for her shopping trips.

>  In the ensuing weeks, officials at Bank Negara Malaysia, under Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, combed through the documents from the raid, revealing a stunning fact: The prime minister had received more than $ 1 billion into his personal accounts between 2011 and 2014. The biggest payments, totaling $ 681 million, were from an unknown company called Tanore, which had an account at Falcon Bank in Singapore.

>  One demonstrator carried an effigy of Najib in a cage; others held up pictures asking how much an average family could purchase of different everyday products—KFC chicken, rice, hot chocolate—with $ 681 million, the biggest transfers into Najib’s accounts; a popular caricature of Rosmah, with cartoonishly big hair, replaced her eyeballs with dollar signs.

>  “Corruption leads to lack of confidence in government. Lack of confidence in government leads to failed states. And failed states lead to terror and national security issues,” was how Special Agent Jeffrey Sallet, chief of the FBI’s Public Corruption Section, put it when announcing the international corruption squads.

>  Police raided Kuala Lumpur apartment units owned by Najib’s family and carted out $ 274 million worth of items, including 12,000 pieces of jewelry, 567 handbags, and 423 watches, as well as $ 28 million in cash.

>  In Macau, the men who greased Low’s movements in China sat tapping on computers while staff organized for Tumi suitcases, stuffed with cash and documents, to move in and out of the hotel suite. As Low’s family members huddled in the rooms, they helped pack up paperwork while aides wiped down countertops with alcohol to avoid fingerprints. The women sat around dressed in Gucci, eating fast food from McDonald’s while checking Instagram.
