>  My pitch ran the risk of sounding fulsome: another salesman, full of blarney. But it’s only blarney if you can’t make it happen. If you can, then it’s the truth—and the truth is the supreme sales tool.

>  Before the DVR and video on demand, the TV business was all about counterprogramming. The networks eyed their programming boards, which displayed the competition’s shows, and asked, “What’ll play against this? And that?” The Tonight Show had always seemed unassailable because nobody could match Johnny.

>  But what would Dave think? Years before, when asked about The Tonight Show, he’d said, “If I weren’t asked someday to do it, I’d feel kind of sad. Yet doing it—that’s my worst nightmare. . . . Maybe the prudent thing would be to let some other poor bastard walk into the fray for several months and then try doing the show.” NBC was leading us to precisely that point, with Jay Leno playing the poor bastard.

>  We were encouraged by how weak NBC’s offer was; we could recommend against it without reservation. But even novice agents know that the first offer is never the best or final one.

>  Sometimes, representing a client’s best interests means not getting him what he thinks he wants. The judgment part of the job requires knowing when to redirect a client’s desires.

>  My life is a story of three valleys. I began in the San Fernando Valley, wound up in Silicon Valley, and spent the intervening decades in a Valley I’d dug for myself.

>  I was also impressed by an Errol Flynn western where he drew a line in the dirt during a mutiny and said, “You’re either with me or against me.” That formulation—you’re totally in or totally out—became my mantra. It helped me enormously later. And it hurt me in equal measure, because it didn’t allow for shades of gray. Most of life turns out to be in shades of gray.

>  This grudge against my surroundings, this sense that I had been raised in the wrong nest, like a cuckoo’s egg, fueled me when I began my working life. I always felt one step inferior to the people around me, and one step superior. I wasn’t as creative or cultured as they were, but I was a lot smarter and more hardworking than most of them. Insecurity and ambition make a powerful cocktail.

>  Through baseball he knew a south side father named Herb Steinberg, MCA’s head of publicity, who agreed to recommend me. I had a strong résumé, but Herb’s referral really helped. That was my first lesson in the business: who you know matters. I was the only high school student MCA hired.

>  After moving to Los Angeles from Chicago in the late 1930s, Lew built the town’s paramount talent agency. His rules were simple: tend to the client, dress appropriately, divulge no information about MCA, do your homework, never leave the office without returning every phone call. He insisted on dark suits, white shirts, and a dark blue or dark gray tie, and he’d sweep papers left on people’s desks into the wastebasket at the end of the day. His credo was “Messy desk, messy mind.”

>  In 1962, after MCA bought Universal, the U.S. Department of Justice (run by Lew’s friend Bobby Kennedy) moved against the company for antitrust violations. Lew could have sold his agency intact to the next generation, as we did later at CAA. Instead, he used Kennedy’s threat as a pretext to break it up and scatter his top agents to a dozen boutique outfits. Sellers were Balkanized and their power neutered—brilliant!

>  And I brought her little gifts—a box of candy, a scarf. One day I said, “You know, I’d love to read some of the files.” She told me to make myself at home. Within a week she was letting me stay on after she left. Then she gave me a key. While other trainees waited to be told what to do and read and learn, I entered Mary’s domain each morning at 7: 00 and every evening after work. For ten weeks I made my way from A to Z, through the client files and the network and studio deals. I jotted questions for Sam Sacks, the head of television legal affairs, who was charmed by my interest and lent me a tape of a talk he’d given at USC on contract law in entertainment. I played it at home and came back with more questions. He gave me nine more tapes.

>  The Ann Miller meeting was like the first time you realize your parents are old. I’d played by the rules at William Morris, and so far it had worked. But I began to ask, What if? What if guys like Ron and me had more of a say? And then: What if we could run a company of our own?

>  Had he told me that he was hurt and that he wanted me to stay, there’s a very good chance I’d have backed down and asked Ron to do the same. I felt no obligation to Bill and Mike and Rowland. If Sam had played it smart, he might have broken up the whole thing before it started. Instead, he fixed me with an arrogant stare and said, “You’ve really screwed yourself this time.” His bad eye was twitching up a storm. I said, “Look, it is what it is.” I went to my office, packed up my Rolodex, and left the building for the last time.

>  But it was a devastating blow; the other clients we had wouldn’t bring in enough to support us. For years, we used the story of Jack Weston and Kelly Lange not following us, after they’d sworn up and down that they would, to teach our young agents. “Don’t ever think that what is, is—because it isn’t. Never count on anybody or anything.”

>  “I’m suggesting you send me a handwritten letter within the next two hours withdrawing the first letter. Or tomorrow morning I’ll call my friend.” Then I thanked him and hung up. I gave no thought to the repercussions—or to the fact that I was bluffing, because we’d be out of business before the feds could get around to dealing with the call I’d never make anyway to a friend I didn’t have. I played my hand as calmly as I could and waited for the outcome. Only after I’d hung up did I realize my hands were shaking.

>  And a few years later, when Jack Weston told a friend of Ron’s that he wanted to come to CAA, Ron replied, “Tell him he can go fuck himself. Not if he was the last client on earth.” One of the strongest bonds Ron and I shared was a belief that any betrayal must be avenged.

>  It would have been easy to tell Chad to take his $ 90,000 and run. No one would have slammed us for putting him in a bad TV movie. But we killed the offer without a second thought—and that moment established our business bona fides. We were not going to be flesh peddlers. We would put our clients’ long-term interests first.

>  Shōgun had languished at William Morris for three years. CAA got it made. Never mind that the deal almost fell apart twenty times; deals always almost fall apart twenty times. That was the first time we took a client’s far-fetched dream and made it come true.

>  After Arthur became a surprise hit, Steve signed with us. We’d poach by assumption: behave as if we were the client’s agent already, make their dream happen, and then they’d sign. Tragically, the following year, weeks after we had attached Steve to a comedy with Robert Redford, he had a fatal heart attack at forty-four. I was close to Steve, and his death stunned me. But I’m now astonished when I realize how quickly I put it behind me and got back to work building CAA. It took half a day. Don’t look back; someone was definitely going to be gaining on us.

>  We had asked for gross-profit participation, but Wells was offering only net. Gross was our holy grail, because the box-office receipts established how much the studio owed your client; net was nearly worthless, as studios took so many deductions in their accounting that they somehow never showed any profits. As one of David Mamet’s characters says in his play Speed-the-Plow, “Two things I’ve learned, twenty-five years in the entertainment industry. . . . The first one is: there is no net.” (A beat later, he adds, “And I forget the second one.”)

>  The entertainment business was an infrared system. When you got hot, people gravitated toward your heat, which made you hotter.

>  Yet there wasn’t a day when I didn’t walk in the door and get hit by a rush of anxiety. What idea can I come up with today to pay the overhead? There’d be the adrenaline rush when we sent out the internal memo, “Robert Redford is now a client.” Fifteen minutes later it was, What next? In 1979, when I was thirty-three, Ted Ashley at Warner Bros. took me aside and said, “I’m going to give you some great advice.” He grinned ruefully. “And, knowing you, you’re not going to take it. But here it is: I could have worked ten percent less, and it wouldn’t have made a difference in my professional success. But I would have been a lot happier.”

>  “I’m really not that interested,” I told Steve. “Well, what job are you interested in?” he asked. “Yours. I want to learn everything I can, and then someday I’d like to have your job.” He laughed. “That’s the answer I was hoping for,” he said. Instead of feeling threatened or offended, he found my ambition refreshing—the sign of a true leader. I took note of that quality, and tried to mirror Steve’s best aspects at CAA.

>  I replaced Rowland as the firm’s president, and got a larger allocation of shares. In 1982, Mike would retire and we’d buy out his shares for $ 750,000. Professionally, mission accomplished. Emotionally, though, I had just hit the self-destruct button—only it would take sixteen years to go off. Bill Haber never forgave me; he would later say, “Agreeing to give to Michael some of my own shares is the only professional regret I have in my life.”

>  CAA had four commandments: (1) Never lie to your clients or colleagues. (2) Return every call by end of day (or at least have your assistant buy you a day’s grace). (3) Follow up and don’t leave people guessing. Every desk phone at CAA bore the message COMMUNICATE. After our Fred Specktor heard me use that word in every speech I gave, he stuck the plaques on Ron’s phone and mine—and when we admired them, he stuck them on everyone’s phone. It was our version of IBM’s famous imperative to THINK.

>  We worked insanely hard, but we fostered the illusion of working impossibly hard. I believed momentum was everything—once a company relaxed, it was done for.

>  We were democratic dictators. I thought of creating our corporate culture as akin to making a giant pointillist painting, dabbing in a million dots that, when you stood back, came into focus as a coherent picture. Each dot was a detail.

>  And I wrote memos to everyone about everything: the advantages of Pan Am over Continental for flights to New York; the imperative need to look for “any post–1900 female biographical characters that have not been covered in the media” for our client Sally Field to play; specifications for the cake for Marty Scorsese’s fiftieth birthday party (“ Marty likes chocolate and is not averse to coconut”); even how to get Zegna suits at cost plus $ 200 so we’d all look sharp (“ If you are interested, I will set up an appointment for my oldest friend Steve Stearns to come into the office with all of the fabrics for the fall line. If you are not interested, I do not care.”). Sending out ten or more such memos every day, getting every detail just so, was extraordinarily time-consuming. But time was our nest egg.

>  Our corporate culture was American team sports boosterism mixed with Spartan military tactics mixed with Asian philosophy, all overlaid by the communitarian spirit of the Three Musketeers. That culture was a collective endeavor, and one that hundreds of people shaped and defined over the years.

>  I scraped from an eclectic variety of sources, a businessman’s version of Picasso’s method. From law firms, I took our phraseology—Ron was a partner, and so were the people in the mailroom—and also the paramount importance of confidentiality. Our collaborative approach came from the way Magic Johnson ran his fast break with the Lakers. He’d drive it up the middle, have an open shot, and pass it up to feed an unguarded teammate. Who wouldn’t kill to play with that point guard?

>  Ron and Bill thought my emphasis on Sun Tzu was crazy, until they realized that it worked—that our team bought in. In truth, though, the Chinese general was always a bit of a prop. It wasn’t so much what he said that inspired CAA, as the idea that we, a five-year-old company, were adhering to a philosophy from 2,500 years earlier. It gave us instant roots.

>  A few days later, when you drove in, one of our parking concierges (who’d been given a photo of you) would open your car door, greet you with a big smile, and say, “Mr./ Ms. X, great to see you. Really hope you join the family!” or “Hope you have a great meeting!” (They switched up the patter to keep from going stale.) An assistant would escort you to the conference room, where five to ten poised, well-dressed agents would be waiting. They’d already have had a premeeting to script the ideas we’d be presenting, and now, for an hour, they’d pepper you with notions for developing your books and screenplays and shower you with the names of our clients who were eager to be in your films. At the end, we’d finally say, “We want to represent you.” It was hard to resist.

>  Our point of differentiation was that a client got regular phone calls from not one but several agents—all coordinated among the client’s team with the interoffice memos we called buck slips. You just can’t beat five with one. All of our agents really did represent all of our clients.

>  When we hired Rick Nicita from William Morris, he asked if he had to wear a suit; in those days you’d see other agencies’ agents wearing corduroy blazers, and even an occasional suede elbow patch. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,” I said evenly. Rick showed up in a suit.

>  I viewed our people as my children, and for the first ten years I’d call every employee who didn’t show up at work to make sure they were okay and to see if they needed anything, from chicken soup to a good divorce lawyer. I did it out of concern, but I also wanted them to know I was keeping a watchful eye. Our idea was to make everyone feel that our building was a comfort zone—and to balance that with a little anxiety should they step outside the building. We wanted the “Don’t cross those guys!” message to be as obvious as a flashing sign at the border.

>  I told our staff we should know about every news story days or weeks before it was in Variety. The trick was to find the hidden mother lodes of information, and to do that we had to exploit a niche the rest had overlooked. Ron and Bill and I began by handling studio executives’ own employment contracts, as we’d long done for TV execs. We took no fees for this; we were after something more valuable—an inside track. The vice presidents we handled would give us tips and take a second look at our clients.

>  enjoyed seeming all-knowing, the great Oz, but the real point was to signal our agents that we were working at a level above their heads—that if they were planning to leave for a studio job, for instance, we’d know before they’d even discussed their contract.

>  When she was at Brown, I came to the campus to interview Martin Scorsese about creativity, and afterward, at a table with the school’s trustees, I did what I always do—asked questions of everyone, getting them talking about themselves so they’d give me a clue or two that would enable me to pretend I knew of them, even if I hadn’t the faintest idea who they were. Kim, who was at my table, watched these exchanges carefully. Afterward, she told me, “That was a great lesson—how you made everyone feel comfortable and important, while you were learning everything you needed.”

>  But CAA was the first to orchestrate the entire development process. We took an idea (a yet-to-be-published bestseller, a magazine article, a news story), turned it into a script, and shoehorned as many artists into the project as we could. The primary difference with assembling a television show was that we didn’t take a packaging fee for films we put together, just our usual commission on our clients’ fees.

>  When Mike Nichols came to us from ICM, his salary increased overnight from $ 2 million to $ 5 million. He called to ask how I’d done it, and I said, “That is our minimum price for a superstar director, and you are a superstar director.” We needed all our top directors to have that leverage, so we needed to have all the top directors. The buyers’ historical advantage was their stranglehold on distribution. At our apex, CAA matched this advantage with a near monopoly on keystone talent: we had forty-five of the fifty top-grossing directors. So we could tell the studios to take our package or leave it. They didn’t pass too often.

>  We weren’t in a creative medium; we were in a commercially creative medium. Our clients often glossed over that distinction so they could view themselves as artists rather than as talent for hire, but I always kept it in mind.

>  But it was her very agreeableness about the whole extortionate process that stays with me. She was too nice. That meant that people had to be nice to us now; that we had the power to compel. No part of the transaction I muscled through was about helping talented people pursue or refine their vision. It was zero Creative Artists and 100 percent Agency. I had become everything I detested in the sixties when I was a bleeding-heart liberal at UCLA—the very symbol of the establishment. I had become The Man.

>  For instance, I reached out to Felix Rohatyn, the Lazard Frères banker who had almost single-handedly rescued New York City from bankruptcy in the seventies, and who was on the board of MCA and had Lew Wasserman’s ear. I called and asked to see him, saying, “I need no more than ten minutes of your time.” On my next trip to New York, I went to his office, shook hands, and placed my watch on his desk. Then I said, “I’d love to talk to you about how you saved New York, and also how you advise Lew—to learn from the Dean. And I’d love to be helpful to you in L.A. in any way I can.” All to get him talking and to show that I knew what he’d done and that I admired it and wanted to learn from it. After ten minutes, I said, “Thanks so much,” and stood to pick up my watch. Felix—and everyone else I used this stratagem on—asked me to sit back down.

>  He hated the constraints I put on him; hated that I insisted he read the scripts he was sent and respond quickly. The real problem was that he hated being a movie star, hated being fawned over and treated like a rare and valuable commodity. He’d once been a painter, and he would have been much happier if he’d kept doing that. Sydney Pollack told me that Bob was, at heart, deeply embarrassed by acting. All of which was entirely human and understandable. But instead of choosing another profession, he took his unhappiness out on the people around him.

>  Unlike most film royalty, Paul understood the trap of stardom. He told me, “You know, I’ve been a movie star for a long time. And no matter how hard I try to tell myself I’m just a normal person, I keep hearing how wonderful I am. It gets to the point that you start to think you’re something you aren’t.”

>  No picture could get a fair screening after a long delay and two false starts. I hustled him across the street to a coffee shop. Bob Daly and Terry Semel followed. Seconds before they caught up, I whispered into my assistant Jay Moloney’s ear. I heard Bob and Terry out as they pleaded for another try, and at last I said, “Okay, go ahead. But we won’t participate.” Marty shook his head violently, feeling betrayed. I led him to my car for the drive back to Los Angeles. He said, “Aren’t we going in for the screening?” “Nope.” “Why not?” At that instant my car phone rang. I put it on speaker, and heard a frantic Warner’s executive wanting to know where the print was: they couldn’t find it anywhere. Marty looked horrified. I said, “Oh, no! I can’t imagine what happened!” After I hung up, I explained to Marty that I’d told Jay Moloney to secure the film canisters and drop them in my trunk. Marty burst out laughing and could not stop.

>  As I’d become more involved in the New York art scene, I’d begun to see parallels between art and fashion and movies and television—a connection among all things creative. The more deeply I understood painters and sculptors, the better I related to film artists. Art deepened my feel for writers, in particular.

>  Every actor, writer, or director believes he or she is responsible for his or her own success. All I did was sell that belief back to them. “Look, you’re going to make it with or without us,” I’d say. “But we can keep you at the top, because we see every project first, we develop for you, we represent every important studio executive—

>  A lot of agents preyed on people’s anxiety and desperation, pitching themselves as a golden ticket: “You can’t make it without me!” To me, that went against the grain of human nature.

>  If a potential client was reluctant, I’d say, “You should take all the time you need. No pressure.” And by “no pressure,” I meant, “No pressure until the next time I’m in touch, which may be in an hour.”

>  Even the most important clients wouldn’t necessarily get a return call right away. When I signed Marty Scorsese, I told him, “I’m not going to spend an hour on the phone with you a day—then I can’t be doing everything else I need to do to find out what’s going on, and I’m worthless to you.”

>  Agencies are built on the lie that your agent will give you his total attention—but there simply isn’t anywhere near enough time in the day for that.

>  I called Rupert and explained the situation and said, “I would be eternally grateful if this problem went away.” He said, “Michael, I cannot interfere with any of our shows or magazines—you better than anyone should understand that.” He paused, then added, “But I will look into it.” He called back the next day and said, “We have looked high and low for any such video in the Fox library, and we simply cannot find it.” Then he hung up. I owed Rupert forever after that, and contributed to every charity and political candidate he asked me to.

>  Yet treating my clients like family was hard on me and my actual family.

>  They often noticed that though I was playing with them (when they were young) or asking them about their days (when they were older), my attention was elsewhere. “Could you come back to reality?” they’d say, or just “Earth to Dad!” I used the car as a place to return phone calls, viewing travel time as dead time. They, quite rightly, viewed it as family time, and they’d regularly disconnect me or grab the phone from my hand.

>  Like all the great ones, Jay was a gifted manipulator. There was something about his transparent eagerness to have me warm to him that made me warm to him. When he told me he’d graduated from USC, I gave him $ 10,000 to buy some suits so he could work for us as an agent. It turned out he hadn’t quite graduated from USC, but minor details like that didn’t trouble him.

>  Every year I wrote up a one-year, three-year, and five-year plan for us. At year’s end I’d destroy the old ones—I feared another agency getting wind of our plans—and write new ones. The one-year and three-year plans proved to be the most useful: often we accomplished the three-year plan in two.

>  “You know, I’ve been thinking about what you said about outdoor-indoor space.” He pulled out a sheet of onionskin and set it on his desk. “I don’t have the time to do it, but were you talking about this?” He drew a rectangle with a curved form on either side. As his pencil moved, he kept asking, “What do you think of this . . . and that . . . and this?” I tried to contain my excitement as I studied his drawing. “I like this, and this,” I said casually, pointing out details. “And I love that. This is exactly what we want.” “I still can’t do it.” “I’m going to assume you can’t do it, but let’s start anyway. Let’s do some drawings.” “I don’t have time.” “Okay, we’ll get somebody else to do them for your approval. But you have to do the first one.” That was the drawing he’d started sketching in front of me. (The completed version now hangs in my library at home.)

>  In 2012, Earvin and Guggenheim Partners purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers for $ 2.15 billion, the most ever paid for an American sports franchise. We never took a penny in commissions. I guess I was paying Earvin back for all the pleasure he gave me at the Forum.

>  Watching how David worked taught me the efficacy of elegance and understatement, how to sell by not selling. When MoMA was launching a capital campaign, David took Judy and me to dinner, and during the three-and-a-half-hour meal never once mentioned a donation. He just talked about how great I was, how great Judy was, and how magnificent the museum was going to be. Somehow, by the end of the meal, we knew we had to give at least the minimum: $ 5 million.

>  A pillar of CAA’s philosophy was that we told our clients the truth. That didn’t mean we told everyone else the truth. I often had to offer more than I could deliver in order to be able to eventually deliver what I had offered. If the truth was bad for us, we had to change the reality, and then deliver it as what we’d said it was all along. In the meantime, well, you’d get creative.

>  He was my wisest friend and the most steadfast; he was quiet when I succeeded but generous and comforting when I screwed up. As he liked to say, “There’s always another race and another racetrack.” I miss him every fucking day.

>  After I lost, I thought, I do not want to keep being terrorized by a bully who only lives a few blocks away. So I congratulated Scott on beating the crap out of me, praising his power and technique. After that, whenever he came around the corner on his American Flyer bike, I’d wave and call out. A few weeks into my charm offensive, he became my friend and then my protector. It was a great lesson in how to make your enemies your friends.

>  “When I say 6: 00, I mean 6: 00.” He was smiling, but I took his point. Herb was a model of integrity. After Sumner Redstone broke a promise and engaged another investment bank, he sent Allen &amp; Company a token check for $ 1 million. I was in Herb’s office when it arrived. He took out his scissors, cut the check into tiny pieces, and returned them to sender.

>  We earned $ 10 million off the deal. Ron appreciated his share of the profits, but I could tell from hints he dropped that he wasn’t crazy about having to keep CAA running smoothly when I was in Japan or engrossed in spreadsheets. Excited by my new relationship with Akio Morita, and with Japan, I didn’t realize that I was jeopardizing a relationship that was much more important.

>  Then Hirata turned to me and said, “You know, we are interested in learning what it would take to acquire a motion picture studio. We would like to know what you would charge to help us.” I had had my answer planned for weeks. “We’ll charge you nothing,” I said, “unless the job we do makes you happy. If you’re not happy, we’d like only our expenses—no fees.” Hirata said, “And if we’re happy?” “If you’re happy?” I looked him in the eye. “We’d like you to hire a Brink’s truck loaded with gold and send it to our office.”

>  As we drove to the airport, it occurred to me I was out on the longest limb of my life. If the deal fizzled and we didn’t get paid, I’d get pilloried—with my partners at the head of the line. I’d be the Wizard of Oz after the curtain rose and the mic died. But I was never one to dwell on the downside. CAA had gotten where it was by blazing new trails. Besides, we knew where Matsushita could start shopping.

>  The letters asked for the privilege of guiding Matsushita through the wilds of the movie business. They listed their services, each one with a fee. They charged for everything but continental breakfast. Hirata’s smile grew wider as I leafed through them, and I understood: CAA was the only one to forgo a fee letter. In all our dealings in Japan we never had a written contract. Our attitude was, We know you will do the honorable thing. For an old-fashioned businessman like Hirata, that gesture was definitive. Despite his limited English and my nonexistent Japanese, we were going to trust each other.

>  I stayed impassive, but my heart leaped. In any multiplayer contest, you want to be the outlier. I told Gille, “Everyone you’ve met with is in the business of selling assets. But I’m in the business of building assets, and I think you are, too.”

>  We saved our best for last: vividly drawn polar bears swigging Cokes as they watched the aurora borealis as if they were at a drive-in movie. When we needed a mascot for the Christmas season, it was Shelly who’d said, “What’s warmer or furrier or friendlier than a polar bear?” In real life, these animals are stone-cold killers. But curled up on a snow field, taking in the northern lights, they seemed positively lovable. Inspired by the bright primary colors in Bauhaus Stairway, the Roy Lichtenstein in CAA’s atrium, our polar bear vignettes became an animation landmark.

>  Because I couldn’t afford to be human all day long—because I had to seem interested and attentive and farseeing and wise with everyone—it made me less human over time. I became insensitive, impatient, someone to be avoided if at all possible. Colleagues transferred their childhood issues onto me: I was everyone’s distant father or bad mother.

>  Yet his private life scared me to death, because he had no hobbies, no social life, nothing except a close relationship with his grandson, Casey. Lew’s whole being was devoted to MCA and Democratic politics, and without MCA he would no longer be a player. What would he do without his only reasons for being? The question tickled a deep anxiety. For years, I’d viewed CAA as a launching pad for larger opportunities, convinced that I could leave at any time. But what if I was more like Lew than I thought?

>  With a stack of scripts to read in between business calls, Ron worked five hours straight. Terry, meanwhile, had a little something to eat. He picked up a screenplay, leafed through it for an hour, laid it down, and had a glass of wine. He read a few more pages. Then he took a nap. “He’s a buyer,” Ron told me afterward, wistfully. “He does whatever he wants. Everyone calls him, and he doesn’t have to call anybody back.” That sounded pretty good.

>  My dad once told me, “You give your all to your friends and clients, and you expect the same back. But you’re not going to get it. They’ll betray you. I was in sales—I know.” I had argued with him then, but now I decided he was right.

>  I thought. I wasn’t shocked by Bryan’s behavior; he was doing what I would have done. I was shocked that Robin’s wife, Marsha, had allowed Bryan to infiltrate and undermine me. I remembered how grateful she’d seemed in the nineties when I’d gone to bat for her and Robin, reaming out People magazine for breaking its promise to the couple and trumpeting the fact that Marsha had been Robin’s nanny when they met. So I took her betrayal personally. I saw Marsha not long ago in San Francisco, and I felt sick to my stomach.

>  A few years ago, a young exec at TPG, the private equity firm that has bought 52 percent of CAA, casually told me, “I own CAA.” That hit me hard. CAA is still a force in entertainment, but the real heirs to Ron and me are Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, who’ve turned William Morris Endeavor into a multihyphenate business, a new octopus. Ari is now an agent, a producer, an advertiser, and an investment banker. Naturally, he trained at CAA.

>  I sat back down; eBay ended up buying the tech. And as we walked out, John Donahoe put his arm around me and said, “You’ve just learned something very important about the Valley. There are no manners here, just brain challenges. It’s about getting to the truth of the idea any way you can.”

>  Then I added that one way to conceptualize how to think in business is a martial-arts precept: “If you aim at the target, you lose all your power. You have to hit through the target to really smash it.” To get where you want to go, you have to set out to go even further.

>  A few months back I visited the old CAA building, which I still own. After Ron and Bill left the agency, I bought them out of the building; they were afraid that no one would want to occupy it if CAA left. Operating out of fear is bad business.
