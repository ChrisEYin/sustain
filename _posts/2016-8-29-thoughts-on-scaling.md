I've been thinking a lot about what I've learned in startup land to date. The bulk of my experience has been helping Coupa scale from a smaller company to a public company. During my time at there I helped them go from single product to multi product, domestic to international, and ultimately helped build the business from $10M to $100M+ in revenue. 

As a result of this, I've spent some time thinking about scaling a business and what that entails. To help I've read several books on the topic as well as taken [Michael Dearing's](https://twitter.com/mcgd) excellent [General Management](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/classes/foundations-general-management) course. 

I took all this and put this together into a short series of blog posts. I hope you enjoy and feel free to ping me if any thoughts!
