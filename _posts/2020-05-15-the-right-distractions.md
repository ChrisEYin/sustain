I was in a few meetings this week that reminded me of [Chris Dixon’s](https://twitter.com/cdixon) post about how the next big thing will start out by [looking like a toy](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/).

For startups, it’s a tough thing to really internalize & understand. You can quickly go from the new disruptor to the one being disrupted while you’re still trying to execute on your original goal. It’s a tough needle to thread -- when is the new thing a fad or a real trend?

There are so many great examples that are fun to read through, both new and old. Mainframes to client server, Mini computers to desktop PCs, desktop to browser, Blockbuster to Netflix, Barne & Nobles to Amazon, Word to Google Docs, etc. 

In all cases the new products competed on a completely new dimension instead of playing in the incumbents world. And they always come in from an angle the incumbent either can't or won't. The famous example is Kodak inventing digital cameras but refusing to push it out there because they were afraid of it cannibalizing film sales.

So as an incumbent how do you avoid this fate? The companies that I've seen go through all knew about the new thing, but ignored it for too long. And once they began to address it, it was too little too late. 

But for every new toy-like thing that disrupts an established business, there were several others that sprung up and fizzled out. They were aware of these upstarts and were right to ignore them. But all it takes is one to kill you.

So how do you distinguish between real threats vs flashes in the pan? It seems like the standard answer once you're big enough is money. You trade cash for innovation and empower the upstarts to continue to do their thing for some time before you inevitably take control.

This doesn't feel like a good answer. And that's the tough part about managing a business. You have to keep the team focused on the original goal while entertaining the right distractions. Apple obviously did this well with the iPod and iPhone. Netflix too when they went from DVD shipping to fully online streaming service. 

So once past the initial phases, startups should make sure they are always actively trying to kill themselves. It may be the thing that saves them.
