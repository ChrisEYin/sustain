I had [previously written](/2014/08/23/jekyll-related-posts/) about Jekyll's subpar native related posts function (tl;dr - it's a list of recent posts, not an actual list related posts).

Recently upgraded to Jekyll 3.4.3 and quite a few things broke. One of them was the related posts. Found a good alternative [here](http://mnishiguchi.com/2016/05/12/implementing-related-pages-in-jekyll/). Thanks Masatoshi!
