>  Sixteen months later, after selling off Gibson Greeting’s real estate, Wesray and the management took the company public in a stock offering that valued it at $ 290 million. Without leverage (another term for debt), they would have made roughly three and a half times their money. But with the extraordinary ratio of debt in the original deal, Simon and his Wesray partner Raymond Chambers each made more than $ 65 million on their respective $ 330,000 investments—a two-hundred-fold profit. Their phenomenal gain instantly became legend.

>  This sleight of hand worked wonderfully in a rising market that sustained the lofty multiples. But reality caught up with the conglomerates at the end of the 1960s, when a bear market ravaged stocks, the numbers game fizzled out, and investors cooled to the conglomerate model. They came to see that the earnings of the whole were not growing any faster than the earnings of the parts, and that the surging earnings per share was ultimately an illusion. Moreover, managing such large portfolios of unrelated businesses tested even very able managers. Inevitably there were many neglected or poorly managed subsidiaries. Investors increasingly began to put more store in focus and efficiency.

>  chalked up big profits on their investments of the late 1970s and early 1980s, insurance companies and other institutions began to divert a bit of the money they had invested in public stocks and bonds to the new LBO funds. By diversifying their mix of assets to include buyouts and real estate, these investors reduced risk and could boost their overall returns over time.

>  Equity was the smallest slice of the leveraged-buyout financing pie—in that era usually just 5–15 percent of the total price. The rest was debt, typically a combination of bank loans and something called mezzanine debt.

>  handful of big insurance companies, including Prudential Insurance Company of America, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Allstate Insurance Company, supplied most of the mezzanine debt, and it was far and away the hardest piece of the financing for buyout firms to round up.

>  Milken’s insight was that there were lots of young or heavily indebted companies that needed to borrow but couldn’t tap the mainstream bond markets and that there were investors ready to provide them financing if the interest rate was high enough to compensate for the added risk.

>  Renowned for his work ethic, he put in sixteen-hour days starting at 4: 30 A.M. California time, an hour and a half before the markets opened in New York.

>  Though Drexel’s debt was expensive, the terms still beat those of Prudential, and KKR soon stopped tapping insurers altogether and drew exclusively on Drexel’s seemingly bottomless well of junk capital. Kravis called Drexel’s ability to drum up big dollars in a flash “the damnedest thing I’d ever seen.” Before long, the insurance companies’ mezzanine

>  Investors in KKR’s first five funds saw annual returns of at least 25 percent from each and nearly 40 percent from one. They earned back six times their money on the firm’s 1984 fund and a staggering thirteen times their investment on the 1986 fund over time, after KKR’s fees and profit share.

>  The hunted and the hunters each portrayed the other side in stark caricatures, and there was more than a grain of truth to what each side said.

>  No one embodied the raider role better than Carl Icahn, a lanky, caustically witty New York speculator whose tactics were typical.

>  While buyout firms typically enlisted management in their bids, the corporate raiders’ instrument of choice was the uninvited, or hostile, tender offer, a takeover bid that went over the heads of management and appealed directly to shareholders.

>  Though he had made his name and fortune in LBOs, Ted Forstmann became a vocal critic of junk financing. The fiery-tempered Forstmann’s dislike of Kravis by the late 1980s had ripened into a deep-seated loathing. In op-ed pieces and in interviews, Forstmann fulminated about a culture of unbridled excess and a mounting dependency on junk bonds, arguing that it was ruining the LBO business and threatened to destabilize the broader economy.

>  Schwarzman and Peterson had a breakfast ritual, convening at eight thirty nearly every morning in the cafeteria of the former Mayfair Hotel, on Sixty-fifth Street and Park Avenue, now the site of the celebrated restaurant Daniel.

>  The solution they ultimately hit on was to set up new business lines as joint ventures—“ affiliates,” they called them—that would operate under Blackstone’s roof. To lure the right people, they would award generous stakes in the ventures.

>  The fee structure ensured that if the fund was big enough, the financiers would become millionaires even if they never made a dime for their investors.

>  Shortly after they opened shop, they drew up a two-page promotional letter describing their business plan, which they mailed to hundreds of corporate executives and old Lehman clients. They then waited. And waited. And waited. “Pete and I expected business to come flooding in. Of course, it didn’t,” Schwarzman says. “We got a few ‘Congratulations, nice letter’ responses. That was it.”

>  After months crisscrossing the country, their quest had yielded only a single, $ 25 million pledge from New York Life Insurance Company. Eighteen institutions they’d considered strong candidates to invest with Blackstone had rebuffed them.

>  “I’ve thought about this, Pete. We’ve worked together. I’m going to put $ 100 million in your fund, and we would like to be the lead investor.” Keith, it turned out, had come to believe that the Pru was too closely identified with KKR and was in fact eager to forge new relationships. Furthermore, Ray Charles “had a lot of respect for Pete, and that rubbed off on me,” Keith recounts.

>  The buyout had been leveraged in the extreme, with just 3 percent equity, so the payoff was huge: KKR made more than fifty times its money. The deal also flew in the face of the notion that buyout firms seek quick flips. Despite its big profit early on, KKR retained a stake in Safeway for nearly fourteen years.

>  Boards and CEOs knew full well that if they didn’t perform the analyses and make the changes, someone else might take over their company, sack them, and do it themselves.

>  The junk market had cooled in 1989, but that October it completely froze up. The precipitating event was the breakdown of the $ 6.8 billion employee-led buyout of United Airlines. When the senior lenders for that deal got cold feet, it spooked other banks, which, in turn, swore off LBOs.

>  The turn in the market sank Drexel. With losses piling up, the bank filed for bankruptcy in February 1990, putting a nail in the high-yield coffin and punctuating the end of the era. The junk-bond market, which had churned out $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion in new issues annually from 1986 to 1989, all but evaporated. In 1990, just $ 1.4 billion of new bonds were sold.

>  “The first month the funds were up three percent and Steve was happy,” recalls Batten. “The second month they were up four percent, and Steve was even happier.” But around the fourth month Robertson posted a 4 percent loss and Schwarzman was beside himself. “How could this happen?” he fumed to Batten. “Fire him! Fire Robertson!”

>  Schwarzman and Silverman flew to Hong Kong in September to see if a face-to-face meeting could prevent the situation from deteriorating. Cheng started off by asking why he shouldn’t rescind the license. Schwarzman countered by offering to give New World a higher percentage of HFS’s income, a proposal he and Silverman already had made in a fax. “There must be some arrangement we can come to,” Schwarzman said. Dissatisfied with the offer, Cheng told them, “Okay, why don’t you go and figure out whether there’s anything that might be of interest to me.”

>  was now a quarter to noon and Cheng told them he would be leaving soon. “I’m going to play golf at twelve. If we can’t work out some arrangement by then, we’re just going to take the company.” Back to the conference room they trudged. Schwarzman stared glumly at the brilliantly colored fish gliding through the water, thinking, “Here’s my whole career about to disappear like those fish bubbles.”

>  “You know, I never would have taken the company, because I had heard that Henry Silverman is a very good operator, and the U.S. is quite far away,” Schwarzman recalls him saying. “I really was very pleased you bought this. Thank you for your proposal.”

>  Schwarzman was less forgiving. “Roger, right after the bump up in his equity, starts spending maybe one-third of his time on the campaign. Steve wasn’t happy about it,” one former partner says.

>  “There is no one who ever got a scintilla of equity in Blackstone who didn’t feel like it was pulling teeth from Steve. He’s not one of these people who graciously hands out equity,” the same former partner says.

>  Schwarzman would later freely admit he’d sold BlackRock too soon. Though he personally earned a tidy sum on the sale to PNC, if Schwarzman had held on to even 3 percent of BlackRock—less than a third of his ownership stake when BlackRock was sold to PNC—he’d have been about $ 1.3 billion richer by 2010.

>  His primary social deficiency—some viewed it as a strength—was his unvarnished candor. If he thought an idea was flawed or dim-witted, he’d say so.

>  “James saw the world in black and white,” says Kenneth Whitney, a longtime Blackstone partner. Mossman’s personality was similarly split, Whitney says. “He had a great sense of humor, but as soon as he focused on something, he turned very serious. It was like Jekyll and Hyde.” He had an obsessive-compulsive side, sometimes going two or three days without sleep when immersed in a deal. Says Whitney: “He had the kind of personality that only had one speed, full speed ahead.”

>  “He doesn’t have deal fever,” says Simon Lonergan, who worked at Blackstone from 1996 to 2004. “Doing nothing is as good as doing something in James’s mind. He was an analytically rigorous guy—very disciplined.”

>  He dressed the part to perfection, from his back-combed coif to his impeccably tailored Paul Stuart suits and tasseled loafers. Rumor had it that Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street was styled after Tom Hill.

>  The new emphasis on value building was accompanied by a new terminology. “LBO” and “buyout” had become so tarnished that buyout firms started branding what they did as “private equity.” British buyout firms, meanwhile, took to calling their deals “management buyouts” to highlight that the business would be run by familiar faces, though the managers seldom had a controlling stake.

>  The $ 4 billion third buyout fund, which had its final closing in October 1997, elevated Blackstone to the number-two position in private equity. Only KKR, the industry’s perennial kingpin, boasted a larger fund, a $ 5.7 billion vehicle raised in 1996.

>  With hindsight, there was a pattern to the failures. All were highly cyclical companies whose fortunes seesawed with the economy. None were dominant, or even terribly competitive, in their fields. In some cases the opposite was true: The businesses had intractable problems that made it impossible for them to gain traction against bigger and stronger rivals. No one inside Blackstone really understood the businesses that well. On top of all that, Blackstone bought many of them at the wrong time in the economic cycle.

>  young banker who worked on the original deal recalls Stockman explaining how people there would need wallpaper to cover up cracking plaster that was beyond painting. Not only did that seem far-fetched; to the twenty-something banker, just a year or two out of business school, wallpaper seemed passé. “I’m thinking, what do I know,” he says, “but I don’t know anyone who buys wallpaper.” He was right. When Russia defaulted on its debt in 1998, the Eastern European economies sank and global wallpaper sales fell 10–15 percent.

>  At Heartland, Stockman was free to pursue his convictions unchecked, and he poured his investors’ money into midwestern manufacturers, many linked to the auto industry. Nearly all went bust.

>  What happened next was not in the business plan, but it was extraordinarily fortunate. When the Fanch deal closed in 1996, most people who used the Internet dialed in on their regular phone lines to America Online, CompuServe, or another Internet provider. But as websites developed richer and richer content and it became possible to move images and other large files over the Internet, conventional phone connections were painfully slow and computer users demanded high-speed data hookups. Cable companies, whose video transmission networks already had enormous bandwidth (the capacity to send heavy streams of electronic signals), found they could easily adapt their systems to carry phone calls and Internet traffic.

>  By that point, the cable industry, which had been all but written off only a few years earlier, had become a crucial link in the Internet, and “triple play”—phone, Internet, and cable over the same connection—was the buzz in the telecom industry.

>  “There’s no epiphany or one thing he can say,” says James. “When you’re looking at a CEO and entrepreneur, you’ve got to take the measure of his intent and his ability to follow through emotionally and personally.”

>  One of James’s first moves was to impose more discipline on the investment process. He instituted a screening regimen so that partners, who had been free to pursue investment possibilities for weeks or even months without supervision, were required to submit an outline at the outset so management could decide if an opportunity was promising enough to warrant the partner’s time.

>  “All these unlikely things are one in ten, one in twenty, one in fifty, whatever they are, so you don’t put them in your base case because they’re very unlikely.” But they are hazards nonetheless. “The chance of any one of them happening is tiny, but the chance that none of them will happen is also tiny. You multiply it out and you find that there’s [say] a 55 percent chance that one of them will happen, and it kills you.” The same analysis worked on the upside.

>  At the same time, James started a series of internal workshops and strategic reviews. Despite the new procedures, he also sped up decision making, which had been as sluggish as molasses in the past.

>  He “wanted to judge people not just on their talent but on how you trained people, et cetera,” says Guffey.

>  He commissioned an exhaustive study of the firm’s past investments to find out exactly where and how the firm had made its money—and how it had lost it. The report contained some provocative conclusions.

>  Schwarzman had pulled off a feat that none of his peers—and few other entrepreneurs—had managed: bringing in a successor from the outside and sharing real power with him. Moreover, he engineered the transition without the turmoil, bitterness, and recriminations of the firm’s first decade. The raw, and raw-edged, ambition he had shown in driving Blackstone to the top of the private equity heap with time had tempered.

>  Chu had followed an unusual route to Blackstone. While most of his peers were the products of affluent families and Ivy League schools, Chu’s family had fled Vietnam when the United States pulled out, and he had earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Buffalo. After a short stint as a banker, he joined Blackstone in 1990 and soon was apprenticed to the mercurial David Stockman. Chu didn’t shy from questioning his superior’s views and earned a place in Blackstone lore for an incident in 1996 when he was working with Stockman on a proposed investment in an aerospace components maker, Haynes International. When Stockman made his pitch to the investment committee, Schwarzman asked Chu what he thought about Haynes. Chu replied frankly that he didn’t think it would be a good investment. Stockman was so incensed that his underling would undercut his position that he refused to talk to Chu for weeks.

>  Two months after the dividend, in November, Celanese filed papers for an IPO to go public and in January 2005, only eight and a half months after Blackstone won control of the company, Celanese went public again on the New York Stock Exchange. As Chu had predicted, American investors valued the company more highly: at 6.4 times cash flow, or 1.4 “turns” more than Blackstone had paid. Celanese raised close to $ 1 billion in common and preferred stock, $ 803 million of which went to Blackstone and its coinvestors, on top of the dividend they received earlier. Blackstone and the coinvestors had now collected $ 700 million in profit on their $ 612 million investment, and they still owned most of Celanese. By the time they sold the last of their Celanese shares in May 2007, Blackstone and the coinvestors raked in a $ 2.9 billion profit on Celanese—almost five times their money and by far the biggest single gain Blackstone has ever booked.

>  “You’ve got to have a lot of respect for the cycles,” Chu says, looking back. “No matter how smart an investor you are and no matter how great the company and its management team are, if you invested in U.S. or European chemicals in 2007 and exited in 2010, you’d take a loss.”

>  The economic turnaround was a godsend for everyone in the business, but Blackstone outpaced its big rivals. By the end of 2005 the firm’s fourth fund, which it began investing in early 2003, had earned an annual return of more than 70 percent after Blackstone’s share of the profits was taken out, about two and a half times the 20 percent annual rise in the stock market over that period.

>  Another factor magnified the effect: the quotas big pension funds and other investors set for private equity. The mix of institutions investing in buyout funds looked very different in the 2000s from what it had when Peterson and Schwarzman first went rapping on doors in 1986 and 1987.

>  With the business commanding headlines every week, and word spreading of the enormous profits being churned out by buyout funds, the broader investing world wanted in, and it is an immutable law that when Wall Street senses an appetite for “product,” it will find a way to fulfill that desire.

>  Those deals convinced Gray and the two other partners who worked on them, Frank Cohen and Kenneth Caplan, then thirty-two and thirty-three, respectively, that most publicly owned office companies managed their buildings to keep them full so they could maintain steady dividends and didn’t hold out for the highest possible rents, which might create temporary vacancies. They had also learned from Carr and Trizec that many publicly traded property companies were valued by the market at less than the sum of their parts. Before it acquired Trizec in October 2006, Blackstone had lined up buyers for thirteen of Trizec’s buildings, which it sold for $ 2.1 billion, earning an instant $ 300 million

>  “He gave me a pep talk. It was like a revival meeting,” Gray says. “In life, sometimes you need a little confidence booster when you’re thinking about risking your entire career.”

>  there was nonetheless more than a bit of truth to the quip of someone who knows them both that “the psychodynamics of Steve and Henry drove an entire industry.”

>  Any way you looked at it, private equity faced a forbidding landscape. Blackstone was not spared when the financial roof caved in. With no investment profits on the horizon, and fewer new investments in the pipeline, the firm laid off 150 employees at the end of 2008, and its business remained in limbo the next year. As a public company, Blackstone’s stock price served as a daily referendum on the firm and its prospects. In February 2009, with the future in doubt, the stock dipped to $ 3.55, down more than 90 percent from its peak on the triumphant opening day.

>  Schwarzman, who had designed his own compensation to consist almost entirely of investment profits so that his interests would be aligned with those of Blackstone’s investors, collected only his base pay of $ 350,000 in 2008 and 2009—less than one-thousandth of the $ 398 million he made in 2006.

>  “In every fund you get one or two deals where literally everything goes wrong. Freescale was that deal in our fund five,” says Schwarzman. “The last time something like that happened was HFS [the Ramada and Howard Johnson franchisor], where we listed all the things that could go wrong and every one of them happened in the first six months: an invasion in the Middle East, oil prices spiking to then-unprecedented levels, the world being thrown into a global recession and, as a result of that, the [franchise] agreement was thrown into default.”

>  Even if buyouts don’t inherently harm companies, do private equity firms actually add value to businesses while they control them? Or are they instead just like other successful equity investors, such as mutual funds or hedge funds, which buy and sell at a profit without altering the businesses in which they invest?

>  The answer to the first question is clearly no. Private equity as an industry does not harm the economy. The answer to the second and third is that they do sometimes add fundamental economic value, but a good portion of their profits derive from buying and selling at the right moments and leveraging up to accentuate their gains. But that’s no sin.

>  The changes quickly paid off. Hertz’s revenue rose 16 percent in the two years after the buyout and cash flow was up 24 percent or 35 percent, depending on which measure you use. The $ 1 billion dividend that the magazine lambasted the owners for taking was actually no strain on the company, which threw off $ 3.1 billion in cash that year, and its cash flows were rising.

>  The bulk of the improvement took place with only minimal job cuts—barely 2 percent in the first year, despite the office closures. (When home construction slowed in 2007, severely hurting Hertz’s large equipment rental businesses, there were bigger cuts. The company ended that year with 9 percent fewer employees than it had at the time of the buyout, but by then the economy was in recession.)

>  As for quick flips, there are relatively few of those. Investments of less than two years accounted for just 12 percent of private equity–backed companies, while 58 percent of the companies were held five years or more.

>  Any way you figure it, only a small fraction of companies that have gone through LBOs have failed. Those that have were often forced to cut jobs, but few of the businesses ceased to exist. Most were simply taken over by other companies, by new investors, or by their creditors.

>  In an internal analysis of its investments through 2005, Blackstone calculated that more than 63 percent of its profits had come from cyclical plays like UCAR, American Axle, Celanese, and Nalco, though less than 23 percent of its capital had been invested in that kind of deal.

>  By contrast, where Blackstone attempted profound transformations of the companies it bought, as it did with Collins &amp; Aikman, Imperial Home Decor, Allied Waste, and the Callahan cable systems in Germany, its record was dismal. Fourteen percent of its capital had gone to such investments, and together they had lost 2 percent of all the capital the firm had deployed over seventeen years.

>  “If we don’t reinvent ourselves continually, we’re dead,” Schwarzman likes to tell his troops. At the end of the day, there are thousands of sources of pure capital. The trick is to supply something extra. Faced with a sustained contraction of their core buyout businesses, the top tier of private equity firms have been scrambling to reinvent themselves, forming new types of investment funds, setting up shop in emerging markets where they see the potential for more growth, and, in some cases, offering advisory services.
