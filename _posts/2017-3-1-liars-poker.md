>  The astute investor Warren Buffett is fond of saying that any player unaware of the fool in the market probably is the fool in the market.

>  Knowing about markets is knowing about other people’s weaknesses.

>  Ask any astute trader and he’ll tell you that his best work cuts against the conventional wisdom. Good traders tend to do the unexpected.

>  The movements of the trading floor respond to the movements of the markets as if roped together. The American bond market, for example, lurches whenever important economic data are released by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The bond trading floor lurches with it. The markets decide what are important data and what are not. One month it is the U.S. trade deficit, the next month the consumer price index. The point is that the traders know what economic number is the flavor of the month and the trainees don’t.

>  Best of all, he gave us a rule of thumb about information in the markets that I later found useful: “Those who say don’t know, and those who know don’t say.”

>  I don’t do favors. I accumulate debts.

>  “There used to be all these expressions, like ‘It’s more important to be a good man than a good manager.’

>  It was all a great mistake. The market wasn’t exploding because of the megatrends that Bob Dall had listed in his memo to Gutfreund (growth in housing, movement from Rust Belt to Sun Belt, etc.) although those later became factors. The market took off because of a simple tax break. It was as if Steven Jobs had bought office space, built an assembly line, hired two hundred thousand salesmen, and written brochures before he had anything to sell. Then someone else creates the personal computer, and seeing this, Jobs leaps into action, calling his previously useless infrastructure Apple Computer.

>  told him I’d bid [buy] his loans at seventy-five [cents on the dollar] and offer him the others at eighty-five.” The thrift president scratched his head at the numbers. He was selling loans nearly identical to those he was buying, but the difference in yield would leave him out of pocket an unheard-of ten million dollars. Or, to put it another way, the thrift was being asked to pay a transaction fee of ten million dollars to Salomon Brothers. “That doesn’t sound like a very good trade for me,” he said. DiNapoli was ready for that one. “It isn’t, from an economic point of view,” he said, “but look at it this way, if you don’t do it, you’re out of a job.”

>  The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (called Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (called Fannie Mae) between them, by giving their guarantees, were able to transform most home mortgages into government-backed bonds.

>  Lewie Ranieri was the right man at the right place at the right time. “Lewie was willing to take positions in things he didn’t fully understand. He had a trader’s instinct that he trusted. That was important,” says one of his senior traders. “The attitude at Salomon was always, ‘If you believe in it, go with it, but if it doesn’t work, you’re fucked.’ And Lewie responded to this. At other places management says, ‘Well, gee, fellas, do we really want to bet the ranch on this deal?’ Lewie was not only willing to bet the ranch. He was willing to hire people and let them bet the ranch, too. His attitude was: ‘Sure, what the fuck, it’s only a ranch.’ In other shops, he’d have had to write a two-hundred-page memo for a committee that wanted to be sure that what he was doing was safe. He would have had to prove he knew what he was doing. He could never have done that. He knew what he was doing, but he could never have proved it. Had Lewie been assigned to look at the mortgage market at other firms, it wouldn’t have gone anywhere.”

>  Lewie Ranieri, formerly of the Salomon Brothers mailroom and utility bond trading desk, had become the champion of the American homeowner. It was a far more appealing persona than that of the slick, profiteering Wall Street trader. “Lewie had this spiel about building homes for America,” says Bob Dall. “When we’d come out of those meetings, I’d say, ‘C’mon, you don’t think anyone believes that crap, do you?’” But that was what made Ranieri so convincing. He believed that crap.

>  “Then I had more boats than suits,” he says. Other than that he lived modestly, without flashy cars or new homes. The clothes made the man, and everyone noticed the clothes. The suits said, “I haven’t forgotten that I came from the back office, and don’t you fucking forget it either.”

>  For each step forward in market technology they took a step backward in human evolution. As their number grew from six to twenty-five, they became louder, ruder, fatter, and less concerned with their relations with the rest of the firm. Their culture was based on food, and as strange as that sounds, it was stranger still to those who watched mortgage traders eat. “You don’t diet on Christmas Day, and you didn’t diet in the mortgage department.

>  “From that point on,” says Stone, “I was never treated well at the firm. Whenever I lost money on a trade, they’d say, ‘We should have let him go.’”

>  Stone, as usual, spoke his mind. He told Gutfreund that since mortgages were the most profitable area of the firm, the traders should be paid more than the rest of the firm. “That’s when Gutfreund blew up,” recalls one of the traders. “He went on about how it was an honor to work at Salomon Brothers

>  and how the firm, not the people, created the wealth.”

>  By allowing dozens of able mortgage traders to fertilize the mortgage departments of other firms, Salomon Brothers let slip through its fingers the rarest and most valuable asset a Wall Street firm can possess: a monopoly.

>  “I kept telling him, ‘John, you’re selling the technology for a hill of magic beans.’”

>  The transfer of skills and information probably cost Salomon Brothers hundreds of million of dollars.

>  “The difference between Strauss and Ranieri?” says one trader still at Salomon. “That’s easy. Strauss wouldn’t stoop to use the men’s room on the trading floor. He’d go upstairs. Lewie would piss on your desk.”

>  when the firm was run by men who said, “It is more important to be a good man than a good manager,” and meant it.

>  They never understood that the greatness of the firm was its culture. They shattered the culture. Or as the people say, they broke the covenant. They branded themselves forevermore.”

>  Till death did they part, my customer and his bonds. AT&amp; T’s bonds got cheaper and cheaper. Finally, about a month after the ordeal had begun, my customer’s boss inquired into his activities. A loss of about $ 140,000 dutifully raised its hoary head, and my German was fired. Kaboom! He got another job, and as far as I know, his children are well provided for.

>  The trader had said, “You are proof that some people are born to be customers.”

>  it is extremely helpful in a young career because it leaves you fearless. I had the same advantage of recklessness as a driver in a traffic jam with a rent-a-car. The worst anyone could do to my rent-a-career was take it away, and though I did not actively court that fate, the thought of losing my job didn’t trouble me as much as it troubled lifers such as, say, Dash Riprock.

>  If there was a single lesson I took away from Salomon Brothers, it is that rarely do all parties win. The nature of the game is zero sum. A dollar out of my customer’s pocket was a dollar in ours, and vice versa.

>  “Goddammit,” I shout, “get me the manager. Now. Do you know what I’m paying to stay here? Do you?” Then I wake up. “It’s all right,” my wife is saying, “you were just having another hotel nightmare.”

>  Most of the time when markets move, no one has any idea why. A man who can tell a good story can make a good living as a broker.

>  Heavy selling out of the Middle East was an old standby. Since no one ever had any clue what the Arabs were doing with their money or why, no story involving Arabs could ever be refuted. So if you didn’t know why the dollar was falling, you shouted out something about Arabs.

>  Risk, I had learned, was a commodity in itself. Risk could be canned and sold like tomatoes. Different investors place different prices on risk. If you are able, as it were, to buy risk from one investor cheaply and sell it to another investor dearly, you can make money without taking any risk yourself. And this is what we did.

>  My degree in art history finally served my career. I knew all about frauds. Ask yourself: What would a painter do if a rival stole his work and put his name on it? He’d paint a replica and issue a challenge for the rival to do the same. And that’s what I did.

>  That was it. I had just drawn a fourth ace. The opportunist was bluffing, and it was written all over his face. Sitting on a trading floor all day makes you that much more sensitive to people’s little bluffs. They were almost always transparent. And once you caught them, you owned them, like a fish well hooked. You could let them off the hook, or you could reel them in.

>  Only then, after it was too late to reverse the process, did I feel remorse. But not much. Even my conscience was becoming calculating, permitting me to feel just enough guilt to live with myself but not enough to prevent me from doing in creeps.

>  One day my Frenchman, by this time a skeptical owner of eighty-six million dollars of Olympia and York bonds (he eventually escaped with a small profit and never forgave me for the hell I put him through), came to lunch and ran his critical hand along our carved oak banister. He then examined the nearby red and cream

>  wallpaper as if it were a vast furry zit. “I suppose we paid for this, didn’t we?” he asked. The tone in his voice suggested not so much disapproval of our high commissions as dismay at the use to which the proceeds had been put.

>  It was more than I had contributed to society; Christ, if social contribution had been the measure, I should have been billed rather than paid at the end of the year.

>  “You don’t get rich in this business,” said Alexander when I complained privately to him. “You only attain new levels of relative poverty. You think Gutfreund feels rich? I’ll bet not.”

>  The most poisonous was the desire to have more now: short-term greed rather than long-term greed. People who are short-

>  greedy aren’t loyal.

>  He was, after all, merely a trader trading his services. What did they expect? They expected, they said, for him to forget about trading for a moment and consider the importance of loyalty to the firm. And you know what he said to that? He said, “You want loyalty, hire a cocker spaniel.”

>  “I know Michael, and I like Michael,” says Lewie Ranieri, who had been fired by Gutfreund two months before (and now appeared like the Ghost of Christmas Past). “His epitaph should read: He never betrayed a friend, and he never showed mercy towards an enemy.”

>  Still, our most severe misjudgments were not steps we had taken but steps we had neglected to take.

>  The owner of a portfolio of fallen angels, by Milken’s analysis, almost always outperformed the owner of a portfolio of blue-chip bonds. There was a reason: Investors shunned fallen angels out of a fear of seeming imprudent. It is a remarkably simple observation. Like Alexander, Milken noticed that investors were constrained by appearances and, as a result, had left a window of opportunity open for a trader who was not. Thus the herd instinct, the basis for so much human behavior, laid the foundation for a revolution in the world of money.

>  Bonus time was soon upon us, and honesty about the quality of our merchandise was trading at a discount.

>  No one ever showed weakness or vulnerability or need for human kindness. Early on Alexander taught me the importance of a strong exterior. “I learned awhile ago that there was no point to showing weakness,” he said. “When you arrive at six-thirty a.m., having had no sleep the night before, and having lost your best friend in a car accident, and some Big Swinging Dick walks over to your desk, slaps you on the back, and says, ‘How the hell are you?’ you don’t say, ‘I’m really tired and really upset.’ You say, ‘I’m great, how the hell are you?’”

>  It was striking how little control we had of events, particularly in view of how assiduously we cultivated the appearance of being in charge by smoking big cigars and saying fuck all the time.
