Words are ideas. And ideas are most useful when they can be easily transferred to others. 

It’s not easy to absorb new ideas. It not only requires an open receiving mind, but also the right articulation of the idea.

So how you communicate ideas is pretty important. That’s why short & crisp is usually best. 

And this extends beyond just communicating ideas to all communication. Words have a weight to them. The more of them there are, the harder to parse through them.

Take these 2 sentences below —

* I work in product in enterprise saas.
* I am a product management executive working on next generation technologies for modern businesses.

While they say the same thing, one has more words. The words add color, but they make the sentence harder to understand. The sentence feels heavier, harder to carry in your mind all at once.

The best expressed ideas let you try them on, walk around in it, and really feel it out. The worst ones are just words that don’t let you try the idea out at all.

So make sure that all comms are as simple as possible. Less words is almost always better. Nouns & verbs. Everything else is cruft that obfuscates your ideas.
