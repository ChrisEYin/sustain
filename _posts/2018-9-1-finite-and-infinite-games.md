>  A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.

>  It is an invariable principle of all play, finite and infinite, that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play, cannot play.

>  Therefore, we can speak of finite games as having temporal boundaries—to which, of course, all players must agree. But players must agree to the establishment of spatial and numerical boundaries as well. That is, the game must be played within a marked area, and with specified players.

>  There are many games we enter not expecting to win, but in which we nonetheless compete for the highest possible ranking.

>  Of infinite players we can also say that if they play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot play. Otherwise, infinite and finite play stand in the sharpest possible contrast.

>  Indeed, the only purpose of the game is to prevent it from coming to an end, to keep everyone in play. There are no spatial or numerical boundaries to an infinite game.

>  While finite games are externally defined, infinite games are internally defined.

>  To agree on internal limitations is to establish rules of play.

>  It is, in fact, by knowing what the rules are that we know what the game is.

>  A point of great consequence to all finite play follows from this: The agreement of the players to the applicable rules constitutes the ultimate validation of those rules.

>  The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play. The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome—that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others. The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.

>  For this reason the rules of an infinite game have a different status from those of a finite game. They are like the grammar of a living language, where those of a finite game are like the rules of debate. In the former case we observe rules as a way of continuing discourse with each other; in the latter we observe rules as a way of bringing the speech of another person to an end.

>  They are like the grammar of a living language, where those of a finite game are like the rules of debate.

>  The task is to design rules that will allow the players to continue the game by taking these limits into play—even when death is one of the limits. It is in this sense that the game is infinite. This is equivalent to saying that no limitation may be imposed against infinite play. Since limits are taken into play, the play itself cannot be limited.

>  Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries.

>  Some self-veiling is present in all finite games. Players must intentionally forget the inherently voluntary nature of their play, else all competitive effort will desert them.

>  Even more: we make those roles believable to others. It is in the nature of acting, Shaw said, that we are not to see this woman as Ophelia, but Ophelia as this woman.

>  To some extent the actress does not see herself performing but feels her performed emotion and actually says her memorized lines—and yet the very fact that they are performed means that the words and feelings belong to the role and not to the actress.

>  The issue here is not whether self-veiling can be avoided, or even should be avoided. Indeed, no finite play is possible without it. The issue is whether we are ever willing to drop the veil and openly acknowledge, if only to ourselves, that we have freely chosen to face the world through a mask.

>  I may have convinced myself I am Ophelia. But credibility will never suffice to undo the contradictoriness of self-veiling. “To believe is to know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe” (Sartre).

>  “To believe is to know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe” (Sartre).

>  To be serious is to press for a specified conclusion. To be playful is to allow for possibility whatever the cost to oneself.

>  Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role of mother.

>  The fact that a finite game is provisionally dramatic means that it is the intention of each player to eliminate its drama by making a preferred end inevitable. It is the desire of all finite players to be Master Players, to be so perfectly skilled in their play that nothing can surprise them, so perfectly trained that every move in the game is foreseen at the beginning. A true Master Player plays as though the game is already in the past, according to a script whose every detail is known prior to the play itself.

>  A finite player is trained not only to anticipate every future possibility, but to control the future, to prevent it from altering the past.

>  Surprise causes finite play to end; it is the reason for infinite play to continue.

>  Because finite players are trained to prevent the future from altering the past, they must hide their future moves. The unprepared opponent must be kept unprepared. Finite players must appear to be something other than what they are.

>  Because infinite players prepare themselves to be surprised by the future, they play in complete openness. It is not an openness as in candor, but an openness as in vulnerability. It is not a matter of exposing one’s unchanging identity, the true self that has always been, but a way of exposing one’s ceaseless growth, the dynamic self that has yet to be.

>  To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.

>  Life in death concerns those who are titled and whose titles, since they are timeless, may not be extinguished by death. Immortality, in this case, is not a reward but the condition necessary to the possession of rewards. Victors live forever not because their souls are unaffected by death but because their titles must not be forgotten.

>  What the winners of finite games achieve is not properly an afterlife but an afterworld, not continuing existence but continuing recognition of their titles.

>  There is a contradiction here: If the prize for winning finite play is life, then the players are not properly alive. They are competing for life. Life, then, is not play, but the outcome of play. Finite players play to live; they do not live their playing.

>  Life, then, is not play, but the outcome of play. Finite players play to live; they do not live their playing.

>  The contradiction of finite play is that the players desire to bring play to an end for themselves. The paradox of infinite play is that the players desire to continue the play in others.

>  The joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning to start something we cannot finish.

>  When a person is known by title, the attention is on a completed past, on a game already concluded, and not therefore to be played again. A title effectively takes a person out of play. When a person is known only by name, the attention of others is on an open future. We simply cannot know what to expect. Whenever we address each other by name we ignore all scripts, and open the possibility that our relationship will become deeply reciprocal.

>  The titled are powerful. Those around them are expected to yield, to withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will—in the arena in which the title was won.

>  Power is never evident until two or more elements are in opposition. Whichever element can move another is the more powerful.

>  The establishment of the limits makes it possible to know how powerful I am in relation to others.

>  To see power is to look backward in time.

>  We need a term that will stand in contrast to “power” as it acquires its meaning in finite play. Let us say that where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength. A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution. Power is concerned with what has already happened; strength with what has yet to happen.

>  Evil is the termination of infinite play. It is infinite play coming to an end in unheard silence.

>  Your history does not belong to me. We live with each other in a common history.

>  Only that which can change can continue: this is the principle by which infinite players live.

>  “We must learn the fine arts of war and independence so that our children can learn architecture and engineering so that their children may learn the fine arts and painting” (John Quincy Adams).

>  In their own political engagements infinite players make a distinction between society and culture. Society they understand as the sum of those relations that are under some form of public constraint, culture as whatever we do with each other by undirected choice. If society is all that a people feels it must do, culture “is the realm of the variable, free, not necessarily universal, of all that cannot lay claim to compulsive authority” (Burckhardt).

>  Just as infinite play cannot be contained within finite play, culture cannot be authentic if held within the boundaries of a society. Of course, it is often the strategy of a society to initiate and embrace a culture as exclusively its own.

>  If we think of society as all that a people does under the veil of necessity, we must also think of it as a single finite game that includes any number of smaller games within its boundaries.

>  Culture, on the other hand, is an infinite game. Culture has no boundaries. Anyone can be a participant in a culture—anywhere and at any time.

>  Properly speaking, a culture does not have a tradition; it is a tradition.

>  It is apparent to infinite players that wealth is not so much possessed as it is performed.

>  If wealth and might are to be performed, great wealth and great might must be performed brilliantly.

>  The deepest and most consequent struggle of each society is therefore not with other societies, but with the culture that exists within itself—the culture that is itself.

>  Such museums are not designed to protect the art from people, but to protect the people from art.

>  Art that is used against a society or its policies gives up its character as infinite play, and aims for an end. Such art is no less propaganda than that which praises its heroes with high seriousness.

>  “Artists do not create objects, but create by way of objects” (Rank).

>  Art has no scripted roles for its performers. It is precisely because it has none that it is art. Artistry can be found anywhere; indeed, it can only be found anywhere. One must be surprised by it. It cannot be looked for.

>  Such a person cannot go to school to be an artist, but can only go to school as an artist.

>  Infinite players have rules; they just do not forget that rules are an expression of agreement and not a requirement for agreement.

>  This is why patriotism—that is, the desire to protect the power in a society by way of increasing the power of a society—is inherently belligerent.

>  This does not mean that we repeat what was done. To enter a culture is not to do what the others do, but to do whatever one

>  does with the others.

>  Each new adoption of a tradition makes it a new tradition—just as the family into which a child is born existed prior to that birth, but is nonetheless a new family after the birth.

>  A culture is sometimes opposed by suppressing its ideas, its works, even its language. This is a common strategy of a society afraid of the culture growing within its boundaries. But it is a strategy certain to fail, because it confuses the creative activity (poiesis) with the product (poiema) of that activity.

>  Abstracted thought—thought without a thinker—is metaphysics. A society’s metaphysics is its ideology: theories that present themselves as the product of these people or those.

>  War presents itself as necessary for self-protection, when in fact it is necessary for self-identification.

>  Finite players go to war against states because they endanger boundaries; infinite players oppose states because they engender boundaries.

>  “Sometimes it is possible to kill a state without killing a single one of its members; and war gives no right which is not necessary to the gaining of its object” (Rousseau).

>  To speak, or act, or think originally is to erase the boundary of the self.

>  This does not mean that I can see what you see. On the contrary, it is because I cannot see what you see that I can see at all. The discovery that you are the unrepeatable center of your own vision is simultaneous with the discovery that I am the center of my own.

>  “Nature has no outline. Imagination has” (Blake).

>  Each new school of painting is new not because it now contains subject matter ignored in earlier work, but because it sees the limitations previous artists imposed on their subject matter but could not see themselves.

>  am both the outcome of my past and the transformation of my past.

>  Not allowing the past to be past may be the primary source for the seriousness of finite players.

>  The finite player, in other words, must not only have an audience but must have an audience to convince.

>  That is, unless we believe we actually are the losers the audience sees us to be, we will not have the necessary desire to win.

>  The outcome brings the contradiction to perfection: by proving to the audience they were wrong, we prove to ourselves the audience was right.

>  On the contrary, the visibility of our victories only tightens the grip of the failures in our invisible past.

>  In no way is the source of genius external to itself; never is a child moved to genius. Genius arises with touch. Touch is a characteristically paradoxical phenomenon of infinite play.

>  When actors bring themselves to tears by their performance, and not as their performance, they have failed their craft; they have become theatrically inept.

>  If to be touched is to respond from one’s center, it is also to respond as a whole person.

>  The finite player’s interest is not in being healed, or made whole, but in being cured, or made functional. Healing restores me to play, curing restores me to competition in one or another game.

>  Physicians who cure must abstract persons into functions. They treat the illness, not the person. And persons willfully present themselves as functions.

>  To be ill is to be dysfunctional; to be dysfunctional is to be unable to compete in one’s preferred contests. It is a kind of death, an inability to acquire titles.

>  When I am healed I am restored to my center in a way that my freedom as a person is not compromised by my loss of functions.

>  But healing requires no specialists, only those who can come to us out of their own center, and who are prepared to be healed themselves.

>  To use Freud’s famous phrase, the civilized are, therefore, the discontent. We do not become losers in civilization but become civilized as losers.

>  This is also why the only true revolutionary act is not the overthrow of the father by the son—which only reinforces the existing patterns of resentment—but the restoration of genius to sexuality.

>  Since sexuality is the only finite game in which the winner’s prize is the loser, the most desirable form of property is the publicly acknowledged possession of another’s person, a relationship to which the possessed must of course freely consent.

>  Like all finite play it proceeds largely by deception. Sexual desires are usually not directly announced but concealed under a series of feints, gestures, styles of dress, and showy behavior.

>  Seductions are designed to come to an end. Time runs out. The play is finished. All that remains is recollection, the memory of a moment, and perhaps a longing for its repetition.

>  Lovers often sustain vivid reminders of extraordinary moments, but they are reminded at the same time of their impotence in recreating them.

>  As with all finite play, the goal of veiled sexuality is to bring itself to an end.

>  By contrast, infinite players have no interest in seduction or in restricting the freedom of another to one’s own boundaries of play. Infinite players recognize choice in all aspects of sexuality.

>  Who chooses to compete with another can also choose to play with another.

>  Infinite players do not play within sexual boundaries, but with sexual boundaries. They are concerned not with power but with vision.

>  It is not their bodies but their persons they make accessible to others.

>  The triumph of finite sexuality is to be liberated from play into the body. The essence of infinite sexuality is to be liberated into play with the body. In finite sexuality I expect to relate to you as a body; in infinite sexuality I expect to relate to you in your body.

>  Whatever occurs within a game is relatively intelligible with reference to whatever else has happened inside its boundaries, but it is absolutely intelligible with reference to that world for the sake of which its boundaries exist.

>  We cannot have a precise understanding of what it means to be the winner of a contest until we can place the game in the absolute dimensions of a world.

>  An audience does not receive its identity according to the persons within it, but according to the events it observes.

>  We are players in search of a world as often as we are world in search of players, and sometimes we are both at once.

>  I cannot be a finite player without being divided against myself.

>  Inasmuch as the conflict is expressed within the bounded playing of a game, the audience is unified—but its unity consists in its opposition to itself. We cannot become a world without being divided against ourselves.

>  The errors of childhood can be more easily amended than those of adulthood.

>  For the finite player in us freedom is a function of time. We must have time to be free.

>  The periodization of time presupposes a viewer existing outside the boundaries of play, able to see the beginning and the end simultaneously.

>  Time does not pass for an infinite player. Each moment of time is a beginning.

>  For an infinite player there is no such thing as an hour of time. There can be an hour of love, or a day of grieving, or a season of learning, or a period of labor.

>  For the finite player in us freedom is a function of time. We must have the time to be free. For the infinite player in us time is a function of freedom. We are free to have time. A finite player puts play into time. An infinite player puts time into play.

>  the goal of finite play is to win titles for their timelessness, and thus eternal life for oneself, the essence of infinite play is the paradoxical engagement with temporality that Meister Eckhart called “eternal birth.”

>  “One may say ‘the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility’”

>  But the voices of the gods proved to be ignorant and false; they have been silenced by the truth.

>  It is one thing for physics and chemistry to be speaking about nature; it is quite another for physics and chemistry to be the speaking of nature.

>  “We have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning” (Heisenberg).

>  Metaphor is the joining of like to unlike such that one can never become the other. Metaphor requires an irreducibility, an imperturbable indifference of its terms for one another.

>  To kill is to impose a silence that remains a silence. It is the reduction of an unpredictable vitality to a predictable mass, the transformation of the remote into the familiar.

>  If nature is the realm of the unspeakable, history is the realm of the speakable. Indeed, no speaking is possible that is not itself historical.

>  If the silence of nature is the possibility of language, language is the possibility of history.

>  Successful explanations do not draw attention to themselves as modes of speaking, because what is explained is not itself subject to history.

>  can explain nothing to you unless I first draw your attention to patent inadequacies in your knowledge:

>  Knowledge, therefore, is like property. It must be published, declared, or in some other way so displayed that others cannot but take account of it. It must stand in their way. It must be emblematic, pointing backward at its possessor’s competitive skill.

>  It is a speech that promises to silence the loser’s voice.

>  lose a contest is to become obedient; to become obedient is to lose one’s listeners.

>  It is not the role of metaphor to draw our sight to what is there, but to draw our vision toward what is not there and, indeed, cannot be anywhere. Metaphor is horizonal, reminding us that it is one’s vision that is limited, and not what one is viewing.

>  Finite language exists complete before it is spoken. There is first a language—then we learn to speak it. Infinite language exists only as it is spoken. There is first a language—when we learn to speak it.

>  Infinite speech does not expect the hearer to see what is already known to the speaker, but to share a vision the speaker could not have had without the response of the listener.

>  Infinite speech does not end in the obedient silence of the hearer, but continues by way of the attentive silence of the speaker. It is not a silence into which speech has died, but a silence from which speech is born.

>  Finite speech informs another about the world—for the sake of being heard. Infinite speech forms a world about the other—for the sake of listening.

>  Finite speech ends with a silence of closure. Infinite speech begins with a disclosure of silence.

>  Ignoring the issue of truth and falsehood altogether, they offer only vision.

>  Instead of placing one body of knowledge against another, storytellers invite us to return from knowledge to thinking, from a bounded way of looking to an horizonal way of seeing.
