I recently ran across this thread from [Anil Dash](https://twitter.com/anildash) on Twitter. He's riffing off of a different thread from [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/993560378129960960) on paid acquisition & CAC. From that, Anil draws out an insight about the current state of SaaS. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a really great thread. An important thing to understand: you get unsustainable paid-acquisition SaaS companies because of overinvestment in particular players in a market, but that still raises CAC for the other companies in the market, even if they *were* sustainable. <a href="https://t.co/mRYDoQh1Wo">https://t.co/mRYDoQh1Wo</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/994200404597661696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

I suspect there's truth in this. I can think of several sectors that feel overfunded -- there far too many companies playing relative to the TAM. In turn, these companies now have to spend far more money to stand out amidst the deluge of sales & marketing spam. But the amount of money said customer is spending hasn't actually gone up. Hence, the aforementioned problem. The HR & recruiting space comes to mind.

But one of the tweets in his thread drew my attention and caused me to wince a bit. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a good articulation of the business case for going for winner-takes-all in SaaS. The downside here, though, is categories where “winner” = “best at raising VC”, not “best product”, and markets where there’s little or no competition. <a href="https://t.co/gQcnnFJWe8">https://t.co/gQcnnFJWe8</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/994339888089714692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

Without getting into the argument of if the winner becomes those that are the "best at raising VC" (I disagree), the part that caused me to wince was the subtle implication that the best product *should* be the winner. 

We often hear founders & entrepreneurs talking about the quality of a company's product relative to the success of the business. Some variation of "They have a great product, they'll easily take the whole market." or "I can't believe they're going public, the product isn't even that good!"

This is classic Silicon Valley bias -- choosing to only see what we want. The startup scene is still dominated by product & engineering folks, so there is a natural aversion to the _other_ parts of the business (sales & marketing). And because we know how to build products, naturally we evaluate businesses based on how well their products are built.

But that's too simplistic. Customers don't make purchasing decisions solely based on the quality of the product. Customers aren't that rational -- rarely do they have an objective evaluation criteria that maps clearly to their business goals. They buy things because their friends told them to. They buy things because they're trendy. They might even buy a product because they just like the sales person! The list goes on (see [Predictably Irrational](https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248) for more on this). The truth is -- the product you've spent so much time building might not even be a primary part of their decision criteria!

To be clear, I'm not knocking product & eng -- I've been in product my whole career and I'm certainly a firm believer that a great product is the cornerstone of any successful company. What I am saying though, is that this view of "the best product should always win!"" is misguided at best, lazy or self-delusional at worst. 

There's still a floor -- you have to have a good enough product to even compete. But what you should understand is that product is just one part of what a customer is buying. To succeed you have to deeply understand your customer's actual motivations for wanting to buy something and deeply understand the end to end customer journey -- initial interest, consideration set, how/when they evaluate success, etc. to make sure you're actually positioning yourself for success (see [Jobs to be Done](https://jtbd.info/) for more). 

Otherwise you're just being lazy and hiding behind your own competencies instead of truly thinking about how to best reach & serve your customers.
