I've spent a few months in venture now and have gone through several different stages of thinking about my workflow. This job is pretty unstructured and there's a reason why one of the first questions new people ask, "how should I spend my time?"

When I first started and I was still trying to figure out what types of companies were the right fit for us, how to identify and then reach them, etc. I defaulted to my thinking when I was just angel investing. You never know where good ideas come from so I will just literally meet everyone and then figure it out from there. 

My eyes are generally bigger than my stomach and while it's super interesting to meet great founders working on all sorts of interesting problems, it's not necessarily the best use of time. I get a lot of personal satisfaction from learning about new things but this doesn't always translate well to making progress in my job looking for companies that are a good fit for our firm.

I ended up meeting over 120 companies in a quarter across various stages, sectors, etc. and had an amazing time learning about all of them. But ultimately I came to the realization that I had to dial it back a bit. While I had seen a broad set of companies, even found one that we ended up [investing in](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/spruce-is-eliminating-the-drudgery-of-real-estate-and-has-29m-more-from-scale-to-make-sales-easy), it was time to tighten up the filter to be a bit more efficient.

So I swung the pendulum the other way and got super guarded with my time. Now knowing what was likely going to work for us vs not, I became much more diserning with the companies I engaged with and opted out of meeting with dozens of founders I normally would've met with. It wasn't just protecting my time, it was also about helping the founders spend their time as wisely as possible too. 

And then the other day I found a meeting on the calendar and as I went to look at the company's website, I thought to myself "shit, this might not be a fit." Should I just let them know and just cancel the meeting so we don't mutually waste each other's time? But I didn't want to be rude, so we just went through with it. 

The minute I dialed in, I quickly realized how wrong I was. The website was old and out of date -- they were working on something completely different that was in my focus area. On top of that, the founder was great and their approach was super interesting. I ended up really enjoying the conversation, will be tracking and really glad we didn't cancel.

It helped remind me about the power of serendipity. It's so important to let some randommness into your life. In both later stage investing where things are more defined but also when you're in a job longer, I find it easy to get more close minded about companies -- this space is no good, not sure about this source, etc. I felt like being stricter with my criteria and time was helping me play offense instead of defense. But this was a good reminder to stay open minded and while playing offense is good, you have to make sure you leave some time for serendipity to find you.
