>  Until the Civil War, a majority of the money in circulation in the United States was issued by private banks, creating a crazy patchwork of competing bills that could become worth nothing if the issuing bank went down. Many countries at that time relied on circulating coins from other countries.

>  As sociologist Nigel Dodd put it, good money is “able to convert qualitative differences between things into quantitative differences that enable them to be exchanged.”

>  The essential quality of successful money, through time, was not who issued it—or even how portable or durable it was—but rather the number of people willing to use

>  “What we want is fully anonymous, ultra low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. If we get that going (and obviously there are some people trying DigiCash, and a couple of others), the banks will become the obsolete dinosaurs they deserve to become,” Back told the Cypherpunk list soon after releasing hashcash.

>  That ArtForz had not taken advantage of the bug himself was a minor miracle. But it was also what the incentives in the Bitcoin system were designed to encourage. ArtForz had been mining coins himself—using the GPU technology that Laszlo had first pioneered—and he knew that if confidence in the system was undercut his coins would be worthless. The market incentives were working as they were supposed to work. This turn of events also confirmed Gavin’s confidence in the power of decentralized systems. ArtForz was a part of the network, and as such, he didn’t just passively use the network. He and Gavin, and all the others, were helping to build this thing.

>  Ross had movie star looks that won him comparisons to the actor Robert Pattinson, and he had always had an easy time making friends, attracting women, having fun, and grabbing brass rings like his Eagle Scout badge and the graduate school fellowship. His failures after leaving graduate school had led him, by late 2010, to a crisis of confidence in which he turned away from his friends and broke up with his girlfriend for a spell. “I felt ashamed of where my life was,” he wrote in the digital diary he kept on his laptop. “More and more my emotions and thoughts were ruling my life and my word was losing power.”

>  In his own diary, Ross was more frank: “I am creating a year of prosperity and power beyond what I have ever experienced before.”

>  Mike gave Abedier a lesson on the basics of a virtual currency that had no central authority and essentially no transaction fees. When Mike finished his presentation, Abedier told him, “I would never admit it outside this room, but this is how payments probably should work.”

>  The spirit in the restaurant was no small part of what was allowing Bitcoin to survive. A project that seemed aimed at furthering an even greater virtualization and atomization of our world was actually creating a sense of real-world community with people working together, animated by a shared sense of purpose for changing the world. The community, which mostly lived online, wasn’t always this harmonious. But it was possible, and the sense of community was a significant draw for a group of people who didn’t always find it easy to find like-minded people in the ordinary world.

>  Many libertarians and anarchists argued that the good in humans, or in the market, could do the job of regulators, ensuring that bad companies did not survive. But the Bitcoin experience suggested that the penalties meted out by the market are often imposed only after the bad deeds were done and do not serve as a deterrent. When it came down to it, in each case of big theft, Bitcoin users eventually went to government authorities to seek redress—the same authorities that Bitcoin had been designed, at least partly, to obviate.

>  “Our conversation was somewhat deep,” he wrote of his walk with the girl. “I felt compelled to reveal myself to her. It was terrible. I told her I have secrets. She already knows I work with Bitcoin which is also terrible. I’m so stupid. Everyone knows I am working on a Bitcoin exchange. I always thought honesty was the best policy, and now I don’t know what to do. I should’ve just told everyone I am a freelance programmer or something, but I had to tell half truths. It felt wrong to lie completely so I tried to tell the truth without revealing the bad part, but now I am in a jam.”

>  The weakness of the existing system had been evident during the financial crisis when the Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley needed a $ 9 billion infusion from a Japanese firm. The agreement was reached on a Sunday, but the money could not be sent because the wire network was down for the weekend and the next day was Columbus Day. It turned out that even banks couldn’t send each other money on holidays. In order to get around this, the Japanese bank cut an absurd $ 9 billion paper check.

>  At each point along the way, Bitcoin’s survival had required the strengths of a different subset of its believers. In the summer of 2013 it had become clear that if Bitcoin was going to reach a larger audience it would need to learn how to play nice with the existing system. As it turned out, Patrick, a pudgy young father with a warm fuzzy beard, was uniquely positioned to do just that.

>  Bobby was in back-to-back meetings with his staff contemplating ways to stay alive without the payment processors. One of the other Chinese exchanges, Huobi, began taking in customers’ money through the personal bank account of the company’s CEO.

>  Bobby’s Chinese deputies explained that the banks were doing this because, unlike the payment processors, they had not been called into a meeting and warned not to work with Bitcoin. Whereas in the United States, banks were unwilling to do work unless they were explicitly given a green light by regulators—and sometimes not even then—in the Wild West of China, the banks would try just about anything until they were explicitly told it was not allowed.

>  At an event hosted by JPMorgan in the Valley, to discuss Bitcoin, Wences was dismissive when the topic of Jamie Dimon came up: “I think whatever Jamie does or doesn’t do will be as relevant as what the postmaster general did or didn’t do about e-mail.”

>  “To me it feels like you are trying to get the whole world connected with something like Compuserve when everyone already has access to TCP/ IP,” he said, and then paused anxiously to see what kind of response he would get. What he heard back from Gates was more than he could have reasonably hoped for. “You know what? I told the foundation not to touch Bitcoin and that may have been a mistake,” Gates said, amicably. “We are going to call you.”
