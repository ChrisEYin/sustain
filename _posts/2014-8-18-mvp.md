My friends and I are always talking about different startup ideas, and the thing that I've noticed is that people often misunderstand how to think about building early stage products. Building early stage products has nothing to do with building product. Building early stage products is about validating ideas. 

Behind every idea is a belief statement. Once you have [a good one](/startups/2016/08/17/good-ideas/) worth spending time on, the next step is to validate it. And this is where people often go wrong. It's easy to get ahead of yourself and get caught up in designing the perfect solution. But more often than not it's a waste of time.

I'm a believer that the vast majority of ideas can be validated without having to build anything. When you strip down an idea down to its core, it can be tested with something simple, often spreadsheets and email. In fact, the uglier and hackier the solution the better. I've always liked this Reid Hoffman quote:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You may have heard me say: If you&#39;re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you&#39;ve launched too late<a href="https://t.co/r4JyKzzyWO">https://t.co/r4JyKzzyWO</a></p>&mdash; Reid Hoffman (@reidhoffman) <a href="https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/847142924240379904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Especially with all the different no code tools nowadays, you can build a pretty good looking MVP without having to spend money or time writing code or hiring developers. Figure out wha the MVP really is and figure out the fastest way possible to test that. Once you validate the core idea, then you can use tech to scale. You should start out by [doing things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).

A good example is [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/). It stated out with a basic idea â€“ new products are interesting & people want to hear about them. So Ryan first [started a newsletter](http://ryanhoover.me/post/69599262875/the-wisdom-of-the-20-minute-startup), manually curating products and sending emails out to friends. Once the newsletter took off, then he recruited folks to help scale this with software.

[Uncover](https://www.uncover.com/) is another example. The idea is that a big part of retaining talent is rewarding people, so they build a product to reward employees with cool perks. In the beginning, they [manually enabled perks](http://spencerfry.com/do-things-that-don-t-scale-an-uncover-example) to make sure employees would retain better with perks. Once it got some wind behind it and they automated it with software.

Even for technical founders, this is the right way to validate an idea. Embark on the shortest path to validate your solution - whether it's via a manual process or getting a check pre-product. A mockup is worth a million debates & small, manual validations are better than large unvalidated products.

There's obviously a limit to this. Some ideas are rooted in technology and you have to build something to prove that it can even work. But even then, the core idea holds - identify the core idea, test it quickly and cheaply, and after you've validated it then you can scale it up.
