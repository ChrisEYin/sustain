I was speaking with a friend about venture the other day and the topic of waste came up. Venture capital is a game in which [quite a bit of money goes in](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q4-2017/), but [not a lot comes out](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-startups-fail). The vast majority of venture backed startups return nothing, and only a small handful of them generate all the returns. 

The same is seen in startups. Each stage of a business is aimed at solving fundamental problems related to the business, ie things like PMF, distribution, retention, etc. And most of the ideas deployed in these pursuits end of producing little value. Ultimately it’s only a small handful of things that make the difference. The [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) at work.

It got me thinking — are we good at deploying money / resources? Could we achieve the same results with much less? Or is a certain amount of investment needed in order to find the things that ultimately provide the value?

In other words, is the money & time allocated to the "losers" considered waste or is itt necessary? 

First off, let’s [define waste](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/waste):

> Waste is to consume, spend, or employ uselessly or without adequate return; use to no avail or profit; squander.

So waste is something that doesn’t provide an adequate return. An effort that does not contribute to the outcome. 

As mentioned above, the majority of investments or ideas don't end up directly contributing to the outcome. And so the question is -- do we classify the losers as waste?

The answer isn’t as clear as it may seem. While an investment in startup X may not be a financial success, it may lead you to startup Y, which is the real winner. And so that investment in startup X isn’t a waste, it still contributed to the outcome of that fund (even if one level removed).

The problem with classifying decisions as good (helpful) and bad (not helpful) is that it’s usually easier ex-post and pretty hard ex-ante. In hindsight, it’s easier to attribute past decisions ([sometimes incorrectly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error)) to a positive outcome. And over a long enough timescale, you can likely attribute everything to positive outcomes. [Narrative fallacy](https://www.fs.blog/2016/04/narrative-fallacy/) can be a dangerous thing.

But there is clearly a spectrum. Every year thousands of venture firms with the same fund size are started. Most will go nowhere and a few will be good. But all of their portfolios will be largely comprised of duds. So regardless, most investing decisions are mistakes. But clearly some firms make better mistakes than others. 

So then how do we classify good mistakes vs. bad mistakes? An easy way to think about good and bad is through the lens of ROI. If we use ROI, we want to optimize for a high return and a low investment. And if it was easy to assign the values in decisions ex-ante, then nobody would ever make mistakes. But it’s not easy. So maybe a quick definition is:

__Good mistake__: A time and energy bound experiment that is an effort to solve a particular problem.

__Bad mistake__: An unplanned effort in hope to solve a problem. 

The main difference is intention. A good mistakes is more thoughtful than bad. When aiming to make high ROI decisions, you need to make sure you optimize for a large R (return) and a low investment (time & energy). 

To ensure a high R, we have to start by making sure the outcome (result) is known. If you don’t know what you’re aiming for you won’t be able to scope the effort to make sure the ROI is sufficiently large. So start by making sure you know what the desired outcome is and to work backwards in planning out your effort. And then make sure that the effort is both time & energy bound so that you’re minimizing the I. 

So it seems like — for anything that is measured on a long enough time scale, there is going to be inevitably going to be "waste". Our job is then to focus on producing good waste over bad waste.
