>  The amygdala is also involved in the expression of anxiety. 14 Take a deck of cards—half are black, half are red; how much would you wager that the top card is red? That’s about risk. Here’s a deck of cards—at least one is black, at least one is red; how much would you wager that the top card is red? That’s about ambiguity.

>  Expose a rat to an innate trigger of fear—a shock. When this “unconditioned stimulus” occurs, the central amygdala activates, stress hormones are secreted, the sympathetic nervous system mobilizes, and, as a clear end point, the rat freezes in place—“ What was that? What do I do?” Now do some conditioning. Before each shock, expose the rat to a stimulus that normally does not evoke fear, such as a tone. And with repeated coupling of the tone (the conditioned stimulus) with the shock (the unconditioned one), fear conditioning occurs—the sound of the tone alone elicits freezing, stress hormone release, and so on.*

>  Where do these “Ohhh, the tone isn’t scary anymore” neurons get inputs from? The frontal cortex. When we stop fearing something, it isn’t because some amygdaloid neurons have lost their excitability. We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We actively learn that it isn’t anymore.*

>  In other words, the default state is to trust, and what the amygdala does is learn vigilance and distrust.

>  Now that we know about the subparts of the amygdala, it’s informative to consider its extrinsic connections—i.e., what parts of the brain send projection to it, and what parts does it project to?

>  sensory information from various modalities (eyes, ears, skin . . .) courses into the brain, reaching the appropriate cortical region (visual cortex, auditory cortex, tactile cortex . . .) for processing. For example, the visual cortex would engage layers and layers of neurons to turn pixels of retinal stimulation into recognizable images before it can scream to the amygdala, “It’s a gun!”

>  Additionally, the shortcut projections form stronger, more excitable synapses in the BLA than do the ones from the sensory cortex; emotional arousal enhances fear conditioning through this pathway. This shortcut’s power is shown in the case of a man with stroke damage to his visual cortex, producing “cortical blindness.”

>  Remarkably, humans also activate it by thinking about something morally disgusting—social norm violations or individuals who are typically stigmatized in society.

>  The hippocampus decides whether a factoid is worth filing away, depending on whether the amygdala has gotten worked up over it.

>  Logically, when the amygdala wants to mobilize a behavior—say, fleeing—it talks to the frontal cortex, seeking its executive approval. But if sufficiently aroused, the amygdala talks directly to subcortical, reflexive motor pathways. Again, there’s a trade-off—increased speed by bypassing the cortex, but decreased accuracy.

>  Does this mean that the pattern of your autonomic arousal influences what you feel? Not really. But autonomic feedback influences the intensity of what is felt.

>  Again, the opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.

>  the most important theme is the amygdala’s dual role in both aggression and facets of fear and anxiety. Fear and aggression are not inevitably intertwined—not all fear causes aggression, and not all aggression is rooted in fear. Fear typically increases aggression only in those already prone to it; among the subordinate who lack the option of expressing aggression safely, fear does the opposite.

>  What does the frontal cortex do? Its list of expertise includes working memory, executive function (organizing knowledge strategically, and then initiating an action based on an executive decision), gratification postponement, long-term planning, regulation of emotions, and reining in impulsivity.

>  the frontal cortex makes you do the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.

>  The frontal cortex is the last brain region to fully mature, with the most evolutionarily recent subparts the very last. Amazingly, it’s not fully online until people are in their midtwenties.

>  In general, the human brain isn’t unique because we’ve evolved unique types of neurons, neurotransmitters, enzymes, and so on. Human and fly neurons are remarkably similar; the uniqueness is quantitative—for every fly neuron, we have a gazillion more neurons and a bazillion more connections.

>  The sole exception is an obscure type of neuron with a distinctive shape and pattern of wiring, called von Economo neurons (aka spindle neurons). At first they seemed to be unique to humans, but we’ve now found them in other primates, whales, dolphins, and elephants.* That’s an all-star team of socially complex species.

>  Once it has decided, the PFC sends orders via projections to the rest of the frontal cortex, sitting just behind it. Those neurons then talk to the “premotor cortex,” sitting just behind it, which then passes it to the “motor cortex,” which talks to your muscles. And a behavior ensues.* Before

>  In a great study, monkeys were trained to look at a screen of dots of various colors moving in particular directions; depending on a signal, a monkey had to pay attention to either color or movement. Each signal indicating a shift in tasks triggered a burst of PFC activity and, coupled with that, suppression of the stream of information (color or movement) that was now irrelevant. This is the PFC getting you to do the harder thing; remembering that the rule has changed, don’t do the previous habitual response. 39

>  The PFC is essential for categorical thinking, for organizing and thinking about bits of information with different labels.

>  Willpower is more than just a metaphor; self-control is a finite resource. Frontal neurons are expensive cells, and expensive cells are vulnerable cells.

>  But as an important qualifier, soon after we’re potty-trained, doing the harder thing with our bladder muscles becomes automatic. Likewise with other initially demanding frontal tasks. For example, you’re learning a piece of music on the piano, there’s a difficult trill, and each time as you approach it, you think, “Here it comes. Remember, tuck my elbow in, lead with my thumb.” A classic working-memory task. And then one day you realize that you’re five measures past the trill, it went fine, and you didn’t have to think about it. And that’s when doing the trill is transferred from the frontal cortex to more reflexive brain regions (e.g., the cerebellum). This transition to automaticity also happens when you get good at a sport, when metaphorically your body knows what to do without your thinking about it.

>  Often the neurobiology of automaticity mediates doing the hardest moral acts, while the neurobiology of the frontal cortex mediates working hard on a term paper about the subject.

>  if rhesus monkeys are randomly placed into social groups, over the subsequent fifteen months, the bigger the group, the larger the PFC becomes—social complexity expands the frontal cortex.

>  dlPFC is the decider of deciders, the most rational, cognitive, utilitarian, unsentimental part of the PFC. It’s the most recently evolved part of the PFC and the last part to fully mature. It mostly hears from and talks to other cortical regions.

>  Logically, the vmPFC is all about the impact of emotion on decision making. And many of our best and worst behaviors involve interactions of the vmPFC with the limbic system and dlPFC.*

>  Damaging the vmPFC, thus removing limbic input to the PFC, eliminates gut feelings, making decisions harder. Moreover, eventual decisions are highly utilitarian. vmPFC patients are atypically willing to sacrifice one person, including a family member, to save five strangers. 62 They’re more interested in outcomes than in their underlying emotional motives, punishing someone who accidentally kills but not one who tried to kill but failed, because, after all, no one died in the second case. It’s

>  In an inspired study where a keyboard was provided to jazz pianists inside a brain scanner, the vmPFC became more active and the dlPFC less so when subjects improvised. In another study, subjects judged hypothetical harmful acts. Pondering perpetrators’ responsibility activated the dlPFC; deciding the amount of punishment activated the vmPFC.*

>  But while emotion and cognition can be somewhat separable, they’re rarely in opposition. Instead they are intertwined in a collaborative relationship needed for normal function, and as tasks with both emotive and cognitive components become more difficult (making an increasingly complex economic decision in a setting that is increasingly unfair), activity in the two structures becomes more synchronized.

>  Contemplating intentionally killing someone with your own hands activates the decider dlPFC, along with emotion-related regions that respond to aversive stimuli (including a cortical region activated by emotionally laden words), the amygdala, and the vmPFC. The more amygdaloid activation and the more negative emotions the participant reported in deciding, the less likely they were to push. And when people contemplate detachedly pulling a lever that inadvertently kills someone? The dlPFC alone activates. As purely cerebral a decision as choosing which wrench to use to fix a widget. A great study.*

>  In one study a subject would play an economic game with someone, where a player is rewarded under two circumstances: (a) if both players cooperate, each receives a moderate reward, and (b) stabbing the other person in the back gets the subject a big reward, while the other person gets nothing. While both outcomes increased dopaminergic activity, the bigger increase occurred after cooperation.*

>  Punishment activated the dopamine system, especially when subjects had to pay to punish; the greater the dopamine increase during no-cost punishment, the more willing someone was to pay to punish. Punishing norm violations is satisfying.

>  Winning a lottery and winning a bid both activated dopaminergic signaling in subjects; losing a lottery had no effect, while losing a bidding war inhibited dopamine release. Not winning the lottery is bad luck; not winning an auction is social subordination.

>  Thus there’s dopaminergic activation during schadenfreude—gloating over an envied person’s fall from grace.

>  once reward contingencies are learned, dopamine is less about reward than about its anticipation.

>  In other words, the pleasure is in the anticipation of reward, and the reward itself is nearly an afterthought (unless, of course, the reward fails to arrive, in which case it’s the most important thing in the world).

>  The rule is that the light comes on, you press the lever, you get the reward. Now things change. Light comes on, press the lever, get the reward . . . only 50 percent of the time. Remarkably, once that new scenario is learned, far more dopamine is released. Why? Because nothing fuels dopamine release like the “maybe” of intermittent reinforcement.

>  In control subjects there was minimal dopaminergic activation after misses of any sort; among pathological gamblers, a near miss activated the dopamine system like crazy.

>  The circumstance with less information (i.e., that was more about ambiguity than risk) activated the amygdala and silenced dopaminergic signaling; what is perceived to be well-calibrated risk is addictive, while ambiguity is just agitating.

>  In other words, dopamine is not about the happiness of reward. It’s about the happiness of pursuit of reward that has a decent chance of occurring.* 99 This is

>  And a cool neuroimaging study of Knutson’s gives insight into impatient people with steep temporal discounting curves; their accumbens, in effect, underestimates the magnitude of the delayed reward, and their dlPFC overestimates the length of the delay.

>  The greater the P200/ N200 ratio (i.e., the greater the ratio of I’m-feeling-threatened to Hold-on-a-sec), the greater the likelihood of shooting an unarmed black individual.

>  And as we saw, there’s the trade-off: information reaches the amygdala fast but is often inaccurate. 16 The amygdala thinks it knows what it’s seeing before the frontal cortex slams on the brakes; an innocent man reaches for his wallet and dies.

>  Though we derive subliminal information from bodily cues, such as posture, we get the most information from faces.

>  Eyes give the most information. 20 Take pictures of two faces with different emotions, and switch different facial parts between the two with cutting and pasting. What emotion is detected? The one in the eyes.* 21 Eyes often have an implicit censorious power. 22 Post a large picture of a pair of eyes at a bus stop (versus a picture of flowers), and people become more likely to clean up litter.

>  If people around you smell scared, your brain tilts toward concluding that you are too.

>  Nonetheless, interoceptive information influences, if not determines, our emotions. Some brain regions with starring roles in processing social emotions—the PFC, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala—receive lots of interoceptive information. This helps explain a reliable trigger of aggression, namely pain, which activates most of those regions. As a repeating theme, pain does not cause aggression; it amplifies preexisting tendencies toward aggression. In other words, pain makes aggressive people more aggressive, while doing the opposite to unaggressive individuals.

>  But as a complication, the brain can alter the sensitivity of those sensory modalities, making some stimuli more influential.

>  Ultimately, the most important point of this chapter is that in the moments just before we decide upon some of our most consequential acts, we are less rational and autonomous decision makers than we like to think.

>  The challenge hypothesis has a second part to it. When testosterone rises after a challenge, it doesn’t prompt aggression. Instead it prompts whatever behaviors are needed to maintain status.

>  In our world riddled with male violence, the problem isn’t that testosterone can increase levels of aggression. The problem is the frequency with which we reward aggression.

>  Thus, oxytocin and vasopressin facilitate bonding between parent and child and between couples.*

>  Oxytocin, the luv hormone, makes us more prosocial to Us and worse to everyone else. That’s not generic prosociality. That’s ethnocentrism and xenophobia. In other words, the actions of these neuropeptides depend dramatically on context—who you are, your environment, and who that person is.

>  principles.* Estrogen contributes to maternal aggression. But estrogen can also reduce aggression and enhance empathy and emotional recognition. It turns out there are two different types of receptors for estrogen in the brain, mediating these opposing effects and with their levels independently regulated. Thus, same hormone, same levels, different outcome if the brain is set up to respond differently.

>  noted, progesterone, working with estrogen, promotes maternal aggression. However, on its own it decreases aggression and anxiety. Same hormone, same levels, diametrically opposite outcomes depending on the presence of a second hormone.

>  What explains female competitive aggression (in sex-reversal species or “normal” animals)? Those androgens in females are obvious suspects, and in some sex-reversal species females have androgen levels that equal or even trump those in males. 58 Among hyenas, where this occurs, spending fetal life awash in Mom’s plentiful androgens produces a “pseudo-hermaphrodite”*—female hyenas have a fake scrotal sack, no external vagina, and a clitoris that is as large as a penis and gets erect as well.*

>  Thus stress facilitates learning fear associations but impairs learning fear extinction.

>  Stated most broadly, sustained stress impairs risk assessment.

>  I have nothing to say = inside of the neuron is negatively charged. I have something to say = inside is positive.

>  more neurons that neuron A projects to, by definition, the more neurons it can influence; however, the more neurons it projects to, the smaller its average influence will be at each of those target neurons.

>  your average neuron has about ten thousand dendritic spines and about the same number of axon terminals. Factor in a hundred billion neurons, and you see why brains, rather than kidneys, write poetry.

>  there are indeed micro-microscopic gaps between axon terminals and dendritic spines; these gaps are called “synapses”

>  Along comes the action potential that initiated miles away in that neuron’s axon hillock. It sweeps over the terminal and triggers the release of those chemical messengers into the synapse. Which they float across, reaching the dendritic spine on the other side, where they excite the neuron. These chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters.

>  what happens to the neurotransmitter molecules after they bind to the receptors? They don’t bind forever—remember that action potentials occur on the order of a millisecond. Instead they float off the receptors, at which point the neurotransmitters have to be cleaned up. This occurs in one of two ways.

>  some of the most interesting findings that help explain individual differences in the behaviors that concern us in this book relate to amounts of neurotransmitter made and released, and the amounts and functioning of the receptors, reuptake pumps, and degradative enzymes.

>  Thus there are lots of different classes of neurotransmitters, each binding to a unique receptor site that is complementary to its shape.

>  There are dozens of neurotransmitters that have been identified. Some of the most renowned: serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, glutamate (the most excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain), and

>  GABA (the most inhibitory).

>  Neurotransmitters are therefore made from precursors that are plentiful; often they are simple dietary constituents. Serotonin and dopamine, for example, are made from the dietary amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively.

>  Broadly, such drugs fall into two categories: those that increase signaling across a particular type of synapse, and those that decrease it.

>  some of the strategies for increasing signaling: (a) Stimulate more synthesis of the neurotransmitter (for example, by administering the precursor or using a drug that increases the activity of the enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmitter).

>  (b) Administer a synthetic version of the neurotransmitter, or a drug that is structurally close enough to the real thing to fool the receptors.

>  (c) Stimulate the postsynaptic neuron to make more receptors. Fine in theory, but not easily done. (d) Inhibit degradative enzymes so that more of the neurotransmitter sticks around in the synapse. (e) Inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter, prolonging its effects in the synapse.

>  Neuron A releases the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which floats across that “axoaxonic” synapse and binds to receptors on that side of neuron B’s axon terminal. And such an inhibitory effect (i.e., making that –70 mV resting potential even more negative) snuffs out any action potential hurtling down that branch of the axon, keeps it from getting to the

>  very end and releasing neurotransmitter; in the jargon of the field, neuron A is having a neuromodulatory effect on neuron B.

>  Suppose we have a circuit made of two layers of neurons: Neuron A projects to neurons 1, 2, and 3; neuron B projects to 2, 3, and 4, etc. Now let’s show how hypothetical this circuit is by giving neurons A, B, and C completely imaginary functions. Neuron A responds to the picture of the guy on the left, B to the guy in the middle, C to the one on the right: What can neuron 1 learn? How to recognize that particular guy. Neuron 5 is equally specialized. But what can neuron 3 learn? How Victorian gentlemen dressed. It’s the neuron that will help you identify the Victorian in the quartet below: Neuron 3’ s knowledge is general and comes from the overlap of the first layer’s projections. Neurons 2 and 4 are also generalist neurons, but they’re less accurate because they have only two exemplars each. So neuron 3 is at the convergent center of this network. And the fanciest parts of the brain are wired up in a way that resembles this fairy-tale circuit, writ large—at the same time, neuron 3 is a more peripheral element in some other circuit sending projections to it (say, a circuitry that would be drawn perpendicular to this page), neuron 1 is at the very center of some other network in the fourth dimension, and so on. All of these neurons are embedded within multiple networks.

>  What does this produce? The capacity for association, metaphor, analogy, parable, symbol. To link two disparate things, even from different sensory modalities.
