 <p><strong>Primer:</strong></p>

<p>The backstory behind this page is <a href="/2017/09/30/codex-vitae/">here</a>. This is modeled on <a href="https://twitter.com/buster">Buster Benson&#39;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/busterbenson/public">Codex Vitae</a>. In addition, I&#39;ve <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/codex-vitae-635f97552092">read</a> <a href="https://github.com/itamargo/codex/blob/master/Codex.md">several</a> <a href="https://pistevo.com/2017/01/codex-vitae-book-of-life">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/dehowell/codex-vitae">ones</a> <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/pandagirl/codex-vitae/details">that I</a> <a href="https://github.com/rd825/codexvitae/blob/master/codex2017v1.md">found online</a> and the resulting document is a mix of my own thoughts as well as ones borrowed from others. Thanks to everyone out there that helped (both explicitly and implicitly).</p>

<p><strong>If you are Chris:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use the Codex as a repository for your beliefs &amp; values. </li>
<li>Do a monthly or quarterly review of whether my life is in alignment. If not, shoudld my behavior change or should my values change?</li>
<li>Do a annual review of the entire document. Expect beliefs and tactics to change -- don&#39;t hold on to them too rigidly.<br>
</br></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you are not Chris:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.</li>
<li>Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.<br>
</br></li>
</ol>
