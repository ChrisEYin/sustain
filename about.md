Hello! I'm Chris Yin -- 30 years old and living in the Bay Area. Currently VP Product at [Rainforest QA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/) and [investor](https://angel.co/chrisyin) in early stage startups. Before that I was Director of Product Management at [Coupa](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupa) and an early guy at [Xpenser](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xpenser). 

A little about myself -- I grew up in a small town in the Bay Area and moved down to San Diego to go to [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). While I was there I started [Pathways](http://rady.ucsd.edu/ciid/pathways-ventures/), a group for entrepreneurs to hang out and [work](http://nextshark.com/ecoqube-how-this-startup-can-seriously-end-world-hunger/) [on](http://www.premedhq.com) [projects](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131030-net-lessons-for-worlds-poorest) [together](http://ivn.us/2012/12/08/locbit-young-ceo-amongst-citys-core-startups/).

After finshing up school, I helped start a [services firm](http://bespokepartners.com/) and joined my friend [Parand](https://twitter.com/parand) at his startup, [Xpenser](http://xpenser.com/). In 2013 we were [acquired by Coupa](http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2013/04/18/acquired-or-acq-hired-xpenser-adds-expertise-to-coupas-web-services/) and I ended up as Director of Product and in charge of our [Expenses](https://venturebeat.com/2016/01/28/coupas-expense-management-solution-receives-highest-score-for-proficiency/), [Inventory](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupa-software-unveils-inventory-application-120000580.html), and [Mobile](https://www.paystreamadvisors.com/2015-paystream-innovate-award-winners-announced/) products, ultimately helping take the company [public in 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/coupa-ipo-is-another-smash-hit-2016-10). 

I now run the product, design, and support teams at Rainforest QA to help companies ship better software. In my spare time, I invest in early stage  statups with [Kevin Liu](https://twitter.com/ckevinliu), helping companies like [Retool](https://retool.in/), [RideReport](https://ride.report/), [Seldon](https://www.seldon.io/), [Appcues](https://www.appcues.com/), [Culture Robotics](https://culturerobotics.com/), [BioRender](https://biorender.io/) and [more](https://angel.co/chrisyin). I wrote down some [principles](/principles/) I try to live by and a more detailed [Codex Vitae](/codex-vitae/) you can check out too. 

Always looking for great new people & startups to meet with, so [ping me](https://twitter.com/chriseyin/) anytime. Thanks for stopping by!
