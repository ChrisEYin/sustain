	<h5><p>Hello! I&#39;m Chris Yin -- 27 years old living in the Bay Area working at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupa">Coupa</a>, a late stage enterprise software startup as Director of Product Management for Expenses, Inventory, and Mobile. </p>

<p>A little about myself -- I grew up in a small town in the Bay Area. I moved down to San Diego to go to college at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>. While I was there, I met some awesome people and started <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/ciid/pathways-ventures/">Pathways</a>, a group that worked together on various projects &amp; startups. </p>

<p>While at Pathways, I spent a lot of time at <a href="http://ansirsd.com/">AIC</a>, a coworking space, and got to work with some cool companies like <a href="http://nextshark.com/ecoqube-how-this-startup-can-seriously-end-world-hunger/">ADI</a>, <a href="http://www.premedhq.com">PremedHQ</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/06/xpenser-is-the-tripit-for-expense-tracking/">Xpenser</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131030-net-lessons-for-worlds-poorest">KA Lite</a>, <a href="http://ivn.us/2012/12/08/locbit-young-ceo-amongst-citys-core-startups/">LocBit</a> and more. Eventually UCSD decided they wanted Pathways, and we <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/ciid/pathways-ventures/">passed it to them</a>.</p>

<p>After finshing undergrad, I spent some time working and learning how to build software, eventually joining <a href="https://twitter.com/parand">Parand</a> at <a href="http://xpenser.com/">Xpenser</a>. After a few months, we were <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2013/04/18/acquired-or-acq-hired-xpenser-adds-expertise-to-coupas-web-services/">acquired by Coupa</a>, a company out of San Mateo. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a PM at Coupa since and I lead the way building a few of our products -- <a href="http://www.coupa.com/solutions/expense-management-software">Expenses</a>, <a href="http://www.coupa.com/solutions/inventory-system">Inventory</a>, and Mobile (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coupa-expense-reports-requisitions/id599455669?mt=8">iOS</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coupa.android.coupamobile&amp;hl=en">Android</a>). Always cooking up some side projects (<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=christopher.e.yin@gmail.com">let&#39;s chat!</a>), and always down to meet up with cool people. </p></h5>
