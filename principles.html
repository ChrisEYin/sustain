 <p><strong>Primer:</strong></p>

<p>The backstory behind this page is <a href="/2017/09/30/codex-vitae/">here</a>. This was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio">Ray Dalio’s</a> original <a href="https://cldup.com/rrhmdLUQeD.pdf">Principles</a> document. Some of these are original and <a href="https://twitter.com/VJ_Rabindranath/status/913789653366566913">some borrowed</a> from those smarter than me. Thanks to everyone out there that helped (both explicitly and implicitly).</p>
